1
00:00:00,560 --> 00:00:03,120
what you see on your screen is what we

2
00:00:02,240 --> 00:00:05,920
refer to as

3
00:00:03,120 --> 00:00:07,839
agile principles now i'm not going to go

4
00:00:05,920 --> 00:00:09,040
over each and every one of them because

5
00:00:07,839 --> 00:00:10,880
i know you can read

6
00:00:09,040 --> 00:00:12,559
and i'll also create an article about

7
00:00:10,880 --> 00:00:14,960
them but let's go over

8
00:00:12,559 --> 00:00:16,160
some of the key ones let's reflect on

9
00:00:14,960 --> 00:00:18,320
number three

10
00:00:16,160 --> 00:00:19,840
this relates to the concept of sprints

11
00:00:18,320 --> 00:00:22,960
and delivering quickly and

12
00:00:19,840 --> 00:00:24,880
often in agile you deliver in weeks not

13
00:00:22,960 --> 00:00:26,720
in months or years

14
00:00:24,880 --> 00:00:28,320
if you are taking many months to deliver

15
00:00:26,720 --> 00:00:31,119
something you are not

16
00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:32,239
doing agile if you are taking years to

17
00:00:31,119 --> 00:00:35,520
deliver something

18
00:00:32,239 --> 00:00:37,200
you are not doing agile this ideal

19
00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:37,920
principle has to do with the speed of

20
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:39,920
delivery

21
00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:42,079
which in the agile terminology we call

22
00:00:39,920 --> 00:00:44,480
the team's velocity

23
00:00:42,079 --> 00:00:46,000
i will explain that concept later but

24
00:00:44,480 --> 00:00:48,320
keep it in mind

25
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:49,280
the speed of execution is called

26
00:00:48,320 --> 00:00:52,160
velocity

27
00:00:49,280 --> 00:00:53,280
in agile and let's now reflect on number

28
00:00:52,160 --> 00:00:55,039
10.

29
00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:57,520
do you remember the example of building

30
00:00:55,039 --> 00:01:01,039
a skateboard to get from point a to b

31
00:00:57,520 --> 00:01:03,359
instead of building a ferrari simplicity

32
00:01:01,039 --> 00:01:04,400
is one of the most important agile

33
00:01:03,359 --> 00:01:06,240
principles

34
00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:07,840
and one of the reasons why in agile you

35
00:01:06,240 --> 00:01:09,840
can deliver so quickly

36
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:10,880
you build basic and simple solutions

37
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:14,080
which satisfy

38
00:01:10,880 --> 00:01:16,960
the main and most important requirements

39
00:01:14,080 --> 00:01:17,520
you build a skateboard instead of a car

40
00:01:16,960 --> 00:01:20,320
you then

41
00:01:17,520 --> 00:01:22,240
iterate and iterate and over time you

42
00:01:20,320 --> 00:01:25,040
build the ferrari

43
00:01:22,240 --> 00:01:26,159
over time not on one go or from the

44
00:01:25,040 --> 00:01:29,200
beginning

45
00:01:26,159 --> 00:01:32,159
over time you build up as you go

46
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:32,960
and you enhance improve and release

47
00:01:32,159 --> 00:01:35,360
enhance

48
00:01:32,960 --> 00:01:37,200
improve and release people prefer

49
00:01:35,360 --> 00:01:39,840
getting improvements quickly

50
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:41,600
even if they are minor but valuable than

51
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:42,560
waiting a whole year to get something

52
00:01:41,600 --> 00:01:44,000
done

53
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:46,159
think about the mobile apps in your

54
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:48,799
smartphone have you noticed they

55
00:01:46,159 --> 00:01:51,200
automatically update frequently and that

56
00:01:48,799 --> 00:01:52,320
sometimes the improvements are minor but

57
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:55,280
cool

58
00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:57,520
that is agile see you have been

59
00:01:55,280 --> 00:01:58,799
surrounded by agile for a long time you

60
00:01:57,520 --> 00:02:01,520
just didn't know it

61
00:01:58,799 --> 00:02:03,600
but now you do at the end of this course

62
00:02:01,520 --> 00:02:05,119
you will be familiar with agile concepts

63
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:08,000
and tools

64
00:02:05,119 --> 00:02:10,000
so a lot of people think agile is new

65
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:12,400
and that it's mainly for it projects and

66
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:15,120
for developers and project managers

67
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:16,239
well that is a huge misconception about

68
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:18,160
agile

69
00:02:16,239 --> 00:02:19,360
and nothing could be further from the

70
00:02:18,160 --> 00:02:23,040
truth

71
00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:24,800
in reality agile dates back to the 50s

72
00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:28,400
but the real game changer was the

73
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:30,000
release of the agile manifesto in 2001

74
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:31,680
and i won't go over the manifesto in

75
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:33,760
detail but i'll add a link to the

76
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:36,080
resources so you can read about it

77
00:02:33,760 --> 00:02:37,280
the manifesto is basically the essence

78
00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:40,480
of agile

79
00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:40,959
think about it as the bible of agile and

80
00:02:40,480 --> 00:02:43,040
yes

81
00:02:40,959 --> 00:02:44,560
it came out of the iet industry and from

82
00:02:43,040 --> 00:02:47,599
a group of developers

83
00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:48,959
but no agile is not only for developers

84
00:02:47,599 --> 00:02:52,000
and project managers

85
00:02:48,959 --> 00:02:54,480
and it's not only for iot projects

86
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:57,200
agile is actually applied to all

87
00:02:54,480 --> 00:02:59,120
industries and to many types of projects

88
00:02:57,200 --> 00:03:00,319
i have personally applied agile to

89
00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:02,959
commercial projects

90
00:03:00,319 --> 00:03:03,760
operations projects and even personal

91
00:03:02,959 --> 00:03:05,680
projects

92
00:03:03,760 --> 00:03:06,879
and i can tell you that agile works and

93
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:08,640
it works well

94
00:03:06,879 --> 00:03:10,959
try it yourself and learn from the

95
00:03:08,640 --> 00:03:12,480
process reflect for improvement

96
00:03:10,959 --> 00:03:14,560
which in agile we would call a

97
00:03:12,480 --> 00:03:16,400
retrospective that is basically the

98
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:18,159
process of reflecting on your mistakes

99
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:20,400
and how you can improve and do things

100
00:03:18,159 --> 00:03:21,200
differently i'll talk more about that

101
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:23,840
later

102
00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:27,920
but for now retrospectives is just

103
00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:27,920
another agile term
