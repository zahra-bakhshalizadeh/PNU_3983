1
00:00:00,960 --> 00:00:05,759
so how is agile different to other

2
00:00:02,800 --> 00:00:08,320
methodologies or ways of doing things

3
00:00:05,759 --> 00:00:09,120
well it's different in many ways for

4
00:00:08,320 --> 00:00:10,800
example

5
00:00:09,120 --> 00:00:12,960
in traditional project delivery you

6
00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:14,639
would start off with an analysis phase

7
00:00:12,960 --> 00:00:16,320
which would take a couple of weeks or a

8
00:00:14,639 --> 00:00:18,080
couple of months then

9
00:00:16,320 --> 00:00:20,240
you would move to a design and spend

10
00:00:18,080 --> 00:00:22,320
again a couple of weeks or months

11
00:00:20,240 --> 00:00:24,480
and then you would actually develop or

12
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:26,880
code after that process

13
00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:27,680
you would pass it on to the qa team for

14
00:00:26,880 --> 00:00:29,439
testing

15
00:00:27,680 --> 00:00:31,599
and you would move to production at the

16
00:00:29,439 --> 00:00:33,920
end after testing

17
00:00:31,599 --> 00:00:35,360
so traditionally in a lot of project

18
00:00:33,920 --> 00:00:36,480
management and project delivery

19
00:00:35,360 --> 00:00:38,320
methodologies

20
00:00:36,480 --> 00:00:40,000
you wouldn't move on from one phase to

21
00:00:38,320 --> 00:00:40,879
the other until that phase has been

22
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,960
completed

23
00:00:40,879 --> 00:00:44,000
until milestones and deliverables have

24
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:46,399
been met

25
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:48,000
and signed off you would also ensure

26
00:00:46,399 --> 00:00:50,719
that scope doesn't change

27
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:52,000
and keep that as constrained as possible

28
00:00:50,719 --> 00:00:53,680
since varying scope

29
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:55,520
would actually translate in the project

30
00:00:53,680 --> 00:00:56,559
taking even longer than originally

31
00:00:55,520 --> 00:00:59,440
planned

32
00:00:56,559 --> 00:01:01,120
and finally in traditional development

33
00:00:59,440 --> 00:01:02,320
you would work on the final solution

34
00:01:01,120 --> 00:01:05,360
from the very beginning

35
00:01:02,320 --> 00:01:07,600
the ferrari the long-term vision the

36
00:01:05,360 --> 00:01:11,119
product with all the bells and whistles

37
00:01:07,600 --> 00:01:13,360
but you wouldn't do any of this in agile

38
00:01:11,119 --> 00:01:14,560
in agile you would actually test from

39
00:01:13,360 --> 00:01:17,759
the very beginning

40
00:01:14,560 --> 00:01:20,000
not just at the end you would also plan

41
00:01:17,759 --> 00:01:22,159
and analyze every two weeks or every

42
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:25,360
time you finish your sprint

43
00:01:22,159 --> 00:01:28,000
and you will deliver iteratively often

44
00:01:25,360 --> 00:01:29,040
and quickly you would also embrace

45
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:31,680
changes in scope

46
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:33,520
when reasonable and required since you

47
00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:34,880
are working iteratively and building

48
00:01:33,520 --> 00:01:37,200
products along the way

49
00:01:34,880 --> 00:01:39,119
you are able to provide more flexibility

50
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:40,560
to your end user and customer

51
00:01:39,119 --> 00:01:42,640
and involve them in the development

52
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:44,720
process from the beginning

53
00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:46,159
this is one of the most important

54
00:01:44,720 --> 00:01:48,560
advantages of agile

55
00:01:46,159 --> 00:01:50,320
and a reason why so many business owners

56
00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:52,960
stakeholders and customers

57
00:01:50,320 --> 00:01:54,159
love it they have direct input in the

58
00:01:52,960 --> 00:01:56,000
development process

59
00:01:54,159 --> 00:01:57,360
and they do it from the beginning and

60
00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:00,079
they do it often

61
00:01:57,360 --> 00:02:01,280
not just at the end another thing that

62
00:02:00,079 --> 00:02:03,600
makes agile different

63
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:06,159
is that agile focuses more on the actual

64
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:08,399
work than on documentation

65
00:02:06,159 --> 00:02:10,160
now please don't misinterpret this and

66
00:02:08,399 --> 00:02:10,479
leave this course with the misconception

67
00:02:10,160 --> 00:02:13,200
that

68
00:02:10,479 --> 00:02:14,000
agile doesn't involve documentation

69
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:15,520
agile

70
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:18,400
also requires documentation but

71
00:02:15,520 --> 00:02:20,720
documentation is not the main focus

72
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:22,400
it's kept short and simple since the

73
00:02:20,720 --> 00:02:23,599
team needs to focus more on the work

74
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:26,560
than on paper

75
00:02:23,599 --> 00:02:27,680
in agile roles blur and by that i mean

76
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:29,280
that for example

77
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:31,360
everyone in the team can be involved in

78
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:32,879
testing not just the people that would

79
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:34,080
normally do it because that's their

80
00:02:32,879 --> 00:02:37,920
official role

81
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:39,200
tester or test lead so since in agile

82
00:02:37,920 --> 00:02:41,360
you're testing and planning

83
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:43,040
every step of the way well most team

84
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:44,640
members get involved

85
00:02:43,040 --> 00:02:47,280
that doesn't mean that everyone has to

86
00:02:44,640 --> 00:02:49,920
test or their agile dictate set

87
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:51,840
it doesn't some agile projects still use

88
00:02:49,920 --> 00:02:52,720
the official roles for team assignments

89
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:55,200
and tasks

90
00:02:52,720 --> 00:02:55,920
and that's fine the point you need to

91
00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:58,159
understand

92
00:02:55,920 --> 00:02:59,519
is that agile can allow for roles to

93
00:02:58,159 --> 00:03:01,599
blur and overlap

94
00:02:59,519 --> 00:03:03,440
or complement one another and that's

95
00:03:01,599 --> 00:03:05,519
okay people embrace

96
00:03:03,440 --> 00:03:07,360
this in agile and support each other to

97
00:03:05,519 --> 00:03:09,360
ensure the team's success

98
00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:11,200
now in terms of planning well planning

99
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:13,280
is adaptive in agile

100
00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:15,599
and priorities can change for each print

101
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:18,560
depending on what the team defines

102
00:03:15,599 --> 00:03:19,280
and finally in agile requirements can

103
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:22,239
change

104
00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:24,000
and the team is open to those changes

105
00:03:22,239 --> 00:03:24,640
that doesn't mean that agile dictates

106
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,560
that

107
00:03:24,640 --> 00:03:27,760
that you should change requirements it

108
00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:30,080
just means that

109
00:03:27,760 --> 00:03:30,879
the team considers something no longer a

110
00:03:30,080 --> 00:03:34,159
priority

111
00:03:30,879 --> 00:03:35,920
well it can be discovered for example

112
00:03:34,159 --> 00:03:37,840
say you are working on that ecommerce

113
00:03:35,920 --> 00:03:39,920
website and after sprint 2

114
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:41,200
you show a demo to the product owner

115
00:03:39,920 --> 00:03:43,680
which is your customer

116
00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:45,440
or a person who represents him or her

117
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:47,519
and that person now says

118
00:03:45,440 --> 00:03:48,720
that they no longer want to have product

119
00:03:47,519 --> 00:03:51,599
displayed vertically

120
00:03:48,720 --> 00:03:52,720
but now horizontally in traditional

121
00:03:51,599 --> 00:03:55,760
project delivery

122
00:03:52,720 --> 00:03:57,200
you might say well you signed off on

123
00:03:55,760 --> 00:03:58,840
vertical at the beginning

124
00:03:57,200 --> 00:04:00,400
and now it's too late to make that

125
00:03:58,840 --> 00:04:03,040
change but in

126
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:03,920
agile you would say to your customer

127
00:04:03,040 --> 00:04:05,599
sure

128
00:04:03,920 --> 00:04:07,360
by the end of the next print we will

129
00:04:05,599 --> 00:04:09,280
have another demo and show you the

130
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:11,599
changes the improvements

131
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:13,439
given scope is varying you might

132
00:04:11,599 --> 00:04:15,200
negotiate with the product owner

133
00:04:13,439 --> 00:04:17,840
about some of the user stories of the

134
00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:20,239
next print and move them to the next one

135
00:04:17,840 --> 00:04:21,919
or maybe remove them so that you can

136
00:04:20,239 --> 00:04:23,280
actually deliver and meet their

137
00:04:21,919 --> 00:04:26,560
expectations

138
00:04:23,280 --> 00:04:29,400
see the difference that's agile

139
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:32,400
and that is why people love it it's

140
00:04:29,400 --> 00:04:32,400
powerful
