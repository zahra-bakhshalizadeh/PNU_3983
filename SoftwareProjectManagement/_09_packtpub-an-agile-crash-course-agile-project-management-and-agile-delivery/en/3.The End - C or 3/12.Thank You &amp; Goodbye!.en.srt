1
00:00:00,399 --> 00:00:04,720
hey guys thank you very much for

2
00:00:03,040 --> 00:00:06,480
supporting me with this course and for

3
00:00:04,720 --> 00:00:07,200
taking the time to actually go through

4
00:00:06,480 --> 00:00:09,040
it

5
00:00:07,200 --> 00:00:10,559
i feel really excited for you and i want

6
00:00:09,040 --> 00:00:12,320
to say congratulations

7
00:00:10,559 --> 00:00:13,759
you know you made it to the end of the

8
00:00:12,320 --> 00:00:16,000
course and that's huge

9
00:00:13,759 --> 00:00:16,800
it's enormous what most people don't

10
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,560
realize

11
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:20,960
is that actually getting to the end of

12
00:00:18,560 --> 00:00:22,320
the course is not something very common

13
00:00:20,960 --> 00:00:24,080
it doesn't happen every day and it

14
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:26,800
doesn't happen to everyone

15
00:00:24,080 --> 00:00:28,320
actually the global stats of online

16
00:00:26,800 --> 00:00:30,560
education state

17
00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:32,320
that less than 10 of the people that

18
00:00:30,560 --> 00:00:35,040
actually enroll in a course

19
00:00:32,320 --> 00:00:37,360
completed so if we're talking about that

20
00:00:35,040 --> 00:00:40,239
100 people enrolled in a course

21
00:00:37,360 --> 00:00:41,360
well only 10 of them would actually go

22
00:00:40,239 --> 00:00:43,600
through it all

23
00:00:41,360 --> 00:00:44,960
and to the end of the course so if

24
00:00:43,600 --> 00:00:45,680
you've made it to this part of the

25
00:00:44,960 --> 00:00:47,840
course

26
00:00:45,680 --> 00:00:49,039
well i just want to say congratulations

27
00:00:47,840 --> 00:00:51,600
and i just want to say

28
00:00:49,039 --> 00:00:53,440
good job keep up the good work you're

29
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:55,360
actually someone special

30
00:00:53,440 --> 00:00:57,360
you're not like the other 90 of the

31
00:00:55,360 --> 00:00:58,160
people that enroll in a course and don't

32
00:00:57,360 --> 00:01:00,559
complete it

33
00:00:58,160 --> 00:01:02,079
you actually completed the course which

34
00:01:00,559 --> 00:01:03,920
is great it's awesome

35
00:01:02,079 --> 00:01:06,240
but i certainly don't want to convey the

36
00:01:03,920 --> 00:01:08,000
message that not completing a course is

37
00:01:06,240 --> 00:01:10,479
bad it's a bad thing

38
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:12,000
i don't think it is and here's why

39
00:01:10,479 --> 00:01:14,640
technology has evolved

40
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:16,080
education has evolved so when people go

41
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:17,920
to an online course

42
00:01:16,080 --> 00:01:19,200
not all of them are thinking about

43
00:01:17,920 --> 00:01:21,200
completing everything

44
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:22,320
it's not like a regular university you

45
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:24,400
know like people

46
00:01:22,320 --> 00:01:25,920
sometimes they look at a lecture and

47
00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:26,640
they're just interested in that

48
00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:28,960
particular

49
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:30,640
lecture and that's okay that's fine

50
00:01:28,960 --> 00:01:32,560
there's nothing wrong with that

51
00:01:30,640 --> 00:01:34,640
or they might go through the parts of

52
00:01:32,560 --> 00:01:34,960
the course which are most relevant to

53
00:01:34,640 --> 00:01:36,799
them

54
00:01:34,960 --> 00:01:38,000
in their professional life or in their

55
00:01:36,799 --> 00:01:40,880
personal life

56
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:41,439
and again that's okay that's fine you

57
00:01:40,880 --> 00:01:43,520
know

58
00:01:41,439 --> 00:01:45,520
students paid for this so they should be

59
00:01:43,520 --> 00:01:47,360
able to do whatever they want with it

60
00:01:45,520 --> 00:01:48,560
or they should be able to complete it at

61
00:01:47,360 --> 00:01:50,960
their own pace

62
00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:52,240
on any device wherever they want

63
00:01:50,960 --> 00:01:53,840
anywhere in the world

64
00:01:52,240 --> 00:01:55,680
so if they want to take a week to finish

65
00:01:53,840 --> 00:01:58,560
the course if they want to do it in

66
00:01:55,680 --> 00:01:59,439
one day or in a year or in 10 years

67
00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:01,040
that's fine

68
00:01:59,439 --> 00:02:03,040
personally i don't have a problem with

69
00:02:01,040 --> 00:02:04,799
that because i understand that there's

70
00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:07,680
different people with different needs

71
00:02:04,799 --> 00:02:09,200
and the education sector and technology

72
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:11,840
as a sector has evolved

73
00:02:09,200 --> 00:02:13,599
and we need to be open to that but again

74
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:15,680
if you did complete the course

75
00:02:13,599 --> 00:02:17,120
you did a great job you're definitely

76
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:18,640
someone special and i want to

77
00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:19,760
acknowledge that and you'll find really

78
00:02:18,640 --> 00:02:23,520
useful information

79
00:02:19,760 --> 00:02:24,239
in support dot rubio and if you enjoyed

80
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:26,239
the course

81
00:02:24,239 --> 00:02:27,520
and you want to help other students make

82
00:02:26,239 --> 00:02:29,760
the decision of

83
00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:31,599
actually enrolling in this course well

84
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:32,480
please leave a nice review with a good

85
00:02:31,599 --> 00:02:34,319
comment

86
00:02:32,480 --> 00:02:35,920
now if you think there's something that

87
00:02:34,319 --> 00:02:36,319
can be improved that you would have

88
00:02:35,920 --> 00:02:38,080
liked

89
00:02:36,319 --> 00:02:40,239
to be different in the course that's

90
00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:42,319
okay too just send me a message

91
00:02:40,239 --> 00:02:44,400
but please don't leave a negative review

92
00:02:42,319 --> 00:02:46,800
the real value is in constructive

93
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:47,440
positive feedback that can actually help

94
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:50,400
us make

95
00:02:47,440 --> 00:02:50,800
our work better and don't get me wrong i

96
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:52,800
work

97
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:54,319
really hard and i always work really

98
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:55,920
hard in all of my courses

99
00:02:54,319 --> 00:02:58,239
to make sure that you have the best

100
00:02:55,920 --> 00:03:00,000
educational experience i can offer

101
00:02:58,239 --> 00:03:01,280
but that doesn't mean there's no room

102
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:03,519
for improvement there's

103
00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:05,760
always things i can do better and i'm

104
00:03:03,519 --> 00:03:08,480
happy and always welcoming

105
00:03:05,760 --> 00:03:09,280
to constructive feedback which i can

106
00:03:08,480 --> 00:03:11,920
actually use

107
00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:13,760
to improve in what i do but again if you

108
00:03:11,920 --> 00:03:15,440
actually enjoy the experience and you

109
00:03:13,760 --> 00:03:16,720
thought the information and the course

110
00:03:15,440 --> 00:03:19,120
was really valuable

111
00:03:16,720 --> 00:03:21,040
to your work to your projects to your

112
00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:22,879
personal life to what you're doing

113
00:03:21,040 --> 00:03:24,879
to what you're learning and you want to

114
00:03:22,879 --> 00:03:26,640
express that love please leave a nice

115
00:03:24,879 --> 00:03:27,760
review and i will really appreciate it

116
00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:28,959
and i just want to say thank you in

117
00:03:27,760 --> 00:03:31,360
advance if you do

118
00:03:28,959 --> 00:03:33,519
if you don't again no worries do

119
00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:35,280
whatever is best for you so if you do

120
00:03:33,519 --> 00:03:36,000
decide to leave a review with a nice

121
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:37,920
comment

122
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:39,840
thank you very much in advance for doing

123
00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:40,879
that i really appreciate it and that's

124
00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:42,159
really helpful

125
00:03:40,879 --> 00:03:44,400
and again it's kind of like the

126
00:03:42,159 --> 00:03:46,080
completion rate not everyone completes a

127
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:47,680
course right we talked about that less

128
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:49,920
than 10 percent of the people

129
00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:51,040
actually go through the whole course in

130
00:03:49,920 --> 00:03:53,760
online education

131
00:03:51,040 --> 00:03:55,439
the same applies to reviews and ratings

132
00:03:53,760 --> 00:03:56,720
not everyone leaves a rating and not

133
00:03:55,439 --> 00:03:58,480
everyone leaves a review

134
00:03:56,720 --> 00:04:00,560
so if you actually take the time to do

135
00:03:58,480 --> 00:04:02,640
it let me just say right now

136
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:04,640
thank you very much it's really

137
00:04:02,640 --> 00:04:06,560
appreciated and it's really helpful

138
00:04:04,640 --> 00:04:08,560
and if it's positive and constructive

139
00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:11,120
even better you know i love that

140
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:12,239
thank you so much and i just want to say

141
00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:13,920
