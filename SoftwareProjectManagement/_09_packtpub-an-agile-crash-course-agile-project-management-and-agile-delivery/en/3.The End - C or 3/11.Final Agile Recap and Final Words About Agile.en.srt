1
00:00:00,399 --> 00:00:04,160
so you're about to become agile

2
00:00:01,920 --> 00:00:07,279
certified when you finish this course

3
00:00:04,160 --> 00:00:10,000
great congratulations so let's do a

4
00:00:07,279 --> 00:00:12,160
quick and agile recap before we finish

5
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:13,200
see the picture on your screen that's

6
00:00:12,160 --> 00:00:15,519
agile

7
00:00:13,200 --> 00:00:17,520
that's all it's about it's about having

8
00:00:15,519 --> 00:00:20,640
your user stories in a backlog

9
00:00:17,520 --> 00:00:21,760
prioritizing them then choosing which

10
00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:24,720
ones you will work on

11
00:00:21,760 --> 00:00:25,439
over your next sprint then starting your

12
00:00:24,720 --> 00:00:28,800
sprint

13
00:00:25,439 --> 00:00:31,039
and doing daily standups then delivering

14
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:34,239
a product increment every two weeks

15
00:00:31,039 --> 00:00:36,719
so delivering value delivering quickly

16
00:00:34,239 --> 00:00:39,200
and delivering often and it's a

17
00:00:36,719 --> 00:00:41,440
repetitive and iterative process

18
00:00:39,200 --> 00:00:42,480
and of course you're always adjusting

19
00:00:41,440 --> 00:00:43,840
and improving

20
00:00:42,480 --> 00:00:45,520
based on what you discuss in your

21
00:00:43,840 --> 00:00:48,719
retrospectives

22
00:00:45,520 --> 00:00:50,800
that's it that's agile in a nutshell

23
00:00:48,719 --> 00:00:52,800
before we finish the course i wanted to

24
00:00:50,800 --> 00:00:54,960
share some final thoughts

25
00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:56,960
first of all congratulations on taking

26
00:00:54,960 --> 00:00:58,719
the step to learn about agile

27
00:00:56,960 --> 00:01:00,480
it will make a big difference in your

28
00:00:58,719 --> 00:01:02,559
projects trust me

29
00:01:00,480 --> 00:01:05,600
but even beyond that i'm sure you have

30
00:01:02,559 --> 00:01:08,159
enjoyed how easy and simple agile is

31
00:01:05,600 --> 00:01:09,840
how anyone can do it and how it can be

32
00:01:08,159 --> 00:01:13,040
applied to any industry

33
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:15,119
product or project now i wouldn't be

34
00:01:13,040 --> 00:01:16,400
surprised if you still felt a little bit

35
00:01:15,119 --> 00:01:18,880
hesitant or unsure

36
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:20,479
about how to start with agile a lot of

37
00:01:18,880 --> 00:01:21,439
people have some fear about getting

38
00:01:20,479 --> 00:01:23,840
started

39
00:01:21,439 --> 00:01:24,880
they don't want to make any mistakes and

40
00:01:23,840 --> 00:01:27,920
that's okay

41
00:01:24,880 --> 00:01:30,720
don't worry it's okay to make mistakes

42
00:01:27,920 --> 00:01:32,079
the main thing is you learn and adjust

43
00:01:30,720 --> 00:01:35,119
iterate and deliver

44
00:01:32,079 --> 00:01:36,560
the agile way so get started with agile

45
00:01:35,119 --> 00:01:37,520
and let me know if you have any

46
00:01:36,560 --> 00:01:39,520
questions

47
00:01:37,520 --> 00:01:41,280
i'm happy to help where i can and i will

48
00:01:39,520 --> 00:01:43,520
continue to add to this course over time

49
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:47,360
to enhance your learning experience

50
00:01:43,520 --> 00:01:47,360
all the best
