1
00:00:00,399 --> 00:00:05,040
before you start doing agile i recommend

2
00:00:02,399 --> 00:00:07,200
you start with sprint zero or planning

3
00:00:05,040 --> 00:00:08,080
this is really really important and a

4
00:00:07,200 --> 00:00:10,160
lot of teams

5
00:00:08,080 --> 00:00:11,200
skip it and then have issues with their

6
00:00:10,160 --> 00:00:12,559
delivery

7
00:00:11,200 --> 00:00:15,200
or they take longer than they had

8
00:00:12,559 --> 00:00:17,039
expected so follow the six steps on this

9
00:00:15,200 --> 00:00:18,000
list and you will be set to start doing

10
00:00:17,039 --> 00:00:20,080
agile

11
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:21,760
start by defining who will be part of

12
00:00:20,080 --> 00:00:24,400
your team and which role

13
00:00:21,760 --> 00:00:25,920
each person will play so basically who

14
00:00:24,400 --> 00:00:28,640
will be the scrum master

15
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:31,279
who will be the product owner and so on

16
00:00:28,640 --> 00:00:33,520
right after that discuss with the team

17
00:00:31,279 --> 00:00:34,640
the best days for the agile rituals such

18
00:00:33,520 --> 00:00:37,520
as retrospectives

19
00:00:34,640 --> 00:00:38,399
sprint planning and so on for daily

20
00:00:37,520 --> 00:00:41,280
standups

21
00:00:38,399 --> 00:00:43,040
well by default it's meant to be daily

22
00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:44,399
so it's just a matter of agreeing where

23
00:00:43,040 --> 00:00:46,399
you will meet

24
00:00:44,399 --> 00:00:48,800
a lot of teams just meet at someone's

25
00:00:46,399 --> 00:00:49,520
desk and have the 15 minutes stand up

26
00:00:48,800 --> 00:00:52,079
right there

27
00:00:49,520 --> 00:00:53,120
informally it's probably the best

28
00:00:52,079 --> 00:00:55,920
approach

29
00:00:53,120 --> 00:00:57,280
keep it simple and keep it lean if you

30
00:00:55,920 --> 00:01:00,879
don't need 15 minutes

31
00:00:57,280 --> 00:01:03,440
that's fine do it in 5 or 10 even better

32
00:01:00,879 --> 00:01:06,400
the third step in this prep process is

33
00:01:03,440 --> 00:01:09,119
getting your tools ready and set up

34
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:11,040
so your kanban board sticky notes

35
00:01:09,119 --> 00:01:14,080
markers or digital boards

36
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:16,960
etc now let's move to the fourth

37
00:01:14,080 --> 00:01:18,880
step make sure you've covered your basis

38
00:01:16,960 --> 00:01:20,400
by doing your due diligence with things

39
00:01:18,880 --> 00:01:24,240
like the business case

40
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:27,200
budget requirements etc and finally

41
00:01:24,240 --> 00:01:28,560
the last two steps determine any

42
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:30,320
constraints of the project

43
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:32,560
so that you can manage them or mitigate

44
00:01:30,320 --> 00:01:34,240
them and define which days you will make

45
00:01:32,560 --> 00:01:37,520
your releases to production

46
00:01:34,240 --> 00:01:38,560
test etc now you're ready to start doing

47
00:01:37,520 --> 00:01:42,079
agile

48
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:44,720
but how do i start you ask simple

49
00:01:42,079 --> 00:01:46,240
create your user stories assign them

50
00:01:44,720 --> 00:01:48,799
story points

51
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:50,240
define your priorities and move them to

52
00:01:48,799 --> 00:01:53,920
the top of your backlog

53
00:01:50,240 --> 00:01:55,439
and start your first sprint then

54
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:57,840
continue to iterate

55
00:01:55,439 --> 00:01:59,040
and adjust as you go based on what is

56
00:01:57,840 --> 00:02:01,360
working well

57
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:03,759
what isn't and what you could improve

58
00:02:01,360 --> 00:02:08,960
which in agile we call retrospectives

59
00:02:03,759 --> 00:02:08,960
that's it easy simple
