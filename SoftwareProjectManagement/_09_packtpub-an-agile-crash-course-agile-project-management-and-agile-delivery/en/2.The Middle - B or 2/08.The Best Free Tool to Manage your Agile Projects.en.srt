1
00:00:00,560 --> 00:00:04,000
all right guys one of the first things i

2
00:00:02,159 --> 00:00:06,480
want to talk about today

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:08,080
is about trello it's one of my favorite

4
00:00:06,480 --> 00:00:09,200
project management applications and i'll

5
00:00:08,080 --> 00:00:11,440
show you in a second

6
00:00:09,200 --> 00:00:17,279
why i like it so much so let's just go

7
00:00:11,440 --> 00:00:19,520
to trello.com

8
00:00:17,279 --> 00:00:20,720
if you've never seen trello before it

9
00:00:19,520 --> 00:00:23,600
pretty much looks

10
00:00:20,720 --> 00:00:23,600
a little bit like this

11
00:00:24,320 --> 00:00:28,480
it's just a board where you can put

12
00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:30,560
tasks project faces

13
00:00:28,480 --> 00:00:31,519
what people are working on you can set

14
00:00:30,560 --> 00:00:34,079
due dates

15
00:00:31,519 --> 00:00:35,440
create checklists assign tasks to people

16
00:00:34,079 --> 00:00:36,960
you can do a lot of things with trello

17
00:00:35,440 --> 00:00:37,760
and it's very very easy to use very

18
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:39,600
intuitive

19
00:00:37,760 --> 00:00:41,280
you don't need really much training to

20
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:41,920
actually start using it you just have to

21
00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:43,440
give it a go

22
00:00:41,920 --> 00:00:45,840
and you'll see that it's very much

23
00:00:43,440 --> 00:00:48,160
pretty self-explanatory

24
00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:49,520
but aside from that one of the other

25
00:00:48,160 --> 00:00:51,920
great things about trello

26
00:00:49,520 --> 00:00:53,840
is that it's free and there's no limit

27
00:00:51,920 --> 00:00:55,280
in the number of users that you can have

28
00:00:53,840 --> 00:00:57,360
working on a project there there's no

29
00:00:55,280 --> 00:00:59,120
limit of the number of projects you can

30
00:00:57,360 --> 00:01:00,239
put there in your trello so that's one

31
00:00:59,120 --> 00:01:00,879
of the things i really like about it

32
00:01:00,239 --> 00:01:03,680
that it's

33
00:01:00,879 --> 00:01:04,879
free easy to use unlimited users

34
00:01:03,680 --> 00:01:06,479
unlimited projects

35
00:01:04,879 --> 00:01:07,920
there is a paid version which has more

36
00:01:06,479 --> 00:01:09,520
advanced functionality

37
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:11,760
but i found that the free version works

38
00:01:09,520 --> 00:01:12,159
pretty well so give the free version a

39
00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:13,840
go

40
00:01:12,159 --> 00:01:15,520
and if you feel you do need something

41
00:01:13,840 --> 00:01:17,840
else or more advanced functionality

42
00:01:15,520 --> 00:01:19,920
pay for the paid version but like i said

43
00:01:17,840 --> 00:01:21,439
i've never really had to use

44
00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:22,960
the paid version you know with the free

45
00:01:21,439 --> 00:01:23,759
version it's always been more than

46
00:01:22,960 --> 00:01:25,600
enough

47
00:01:23,759 --> 00:01:26,720
and i'll show you about it in just a

48
00:01:25,600 --> 00:01:27,680
second and i'll walk you through the

49
00:01:26,720 --> 00:01:30,000
whole process

50
00:01:27,680 --> 00:01:31,119
so you can see how you log in how you

51
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,560
register how you

52
00:01:31,119 --> 00:01:34,640
set up your project how you set up your

53
00:01:32,560 --> 00:01:37,920
tasks everything how you do it all right

54
00:01:34,640 --> 00:01:39,840
before i do that i just want to look at

55
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:41,200
a video of trello to give you just a

56
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:44,240
quick introduction about it

57
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:44,240
so let's go to youtube

58
00:01:48,880 --> 00:01:57,200
and let's search here for trello

59
00:01:55,759 --> 00:01:59,119
and you can see a lot of videos here

60
00:01:57,200 --> 00:02:01,119
about trello like i said before so just

61
00:01:59,119 --> 00:02:03,119
give it a go and explore some of them

62
00:02:01,119 --> 00:02:04,640
i have looked at a couple of already so

63
00:02:03,119 --> 00:02:06,079
i'm going to go over this one which i

64
00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:06,719
really like because it's very short very

65
00:02:06,079 --> 00:02:08,879
simple

66
00:02:06,719 --> 00:02:10,640

67
00:02:08,879 --> 00:02:23,260

inbox course just to double check that

100
00:05:14,880 --> 00:05:19,039
this is actually a genuine email and

and so that they verify my account we

102
00:05:19,039 --> 00:05:24,479

let's go to gmail online demo d that's

104
00:05:24,479 --> 00:05:31,360

so that's it i'm now verified i'm going

111
00:05:43,039 --> 00:05:45,600
to close this other one which is the one

112
00:05:44,479 --> 00:05:48,400
we're seeing before i

113
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:49,280
was verified and i'm going to close

114
00:05:48,400 --> 00:05:50,639
youtube as well

115
00:05:49,280 --> 00:05:52,720
i'm going to leave the gmail open right

116
00:05:50,639 --> 00:05:55,840
there and let's go here to

117
00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:57,440
welcome board all right so like i said

118
00:05:55,840 --> 00:06:00,560
before

119
00:05:57,440 --> 00:06:02,160
trello is very very easy to use and you

120
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:04,160
can do a lot of things with it so

121
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:07,120
let's just go here to create a board and

122
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:10,160
i'm going to call this

123
00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:13,840
project example

124
00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:16,160
one all right so it's a first project

125
00:06:13,840 --> 00:06:19,039
example

126
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:19,520
right so i mean this is a project right

127
00:06:19,039 --> 00:06:21,840
so

128
00:06:19,520 --> 00:06:23,199
what can i do now now that i'm here well

129
00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:24,639
you can use trello

130
00:06:23,199 --> 00:06:25,759
in a lot of different ways and i'm going

131
00:06:24,639 --> 00:06:27,919
to walk you through some different

132
00:06:25,759 --> 00:06:30,080
examples to give you a sense for it

133
00:06:27,919 --> 00:06:31,199
let's say you want to keep it really

134
00:06:30,080 --> 00:06:33,680
simple and go

135
00:06:31,199 --> 00:06:35,600
with an agile approach to the project so

136
00:06:33,680 --> 00:06:40,160
you can just create

137
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:40,160
probably three main lists to do

138
00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:43,759
doing

139
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:50,000
done that's it let's actually add two

140
00:06:47,919 --> 00:06:51,360
more let's say qa

141
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:54,319
quality assurance and i'm going to put

142
00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:56,800
that before we actually mark it done

143
00:06:54,319 --> 00:06:59,199
and another one i'm going to create here

144
00:06:56,800 --> 00:07:03,840
is something i like to call

145
00:06:59,199 --> 00:07:03,840
parking lot

146
00:07:04,080 --> 00:07:09,680
so out of scope or ideas

147
00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:14,720
and this one is really useful

148
00:07:13,199 --> 00:07:15,759
stakeholder management because a lot of

149
00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:16,880
times when you're working with

150
00:07:15,759 --> 00:07:18,720
stakeholders

151
00:07:16,880 --> 00:07:20,160
or different people on a project they

152
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:21,280
might start you know throwing at you a

153
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:23,199
lot of ideas

154
00:07:21,280 --> 00:07:24,960
and you don't have the money for it you

155
00:07:23,199 --> 00:07:26,560
don't have the time for it

156
00:07:24,960 --> 00:07:28,240
and you don't have the resources for it

157
00:07:26,560 --> 00:07:30,400
but if you don't listen to them

158
00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:31,520
well people will feel that you're not

159
00:07:30,400 --> 00:07:34,080
really paying attention

160
00:07:31,520 --> 00:07:35,520
they'll disengage very quickly and it's

161
00:07:34,080 --> 00:07:36,639
just not a good practice so you actually

162
00:07:35,520 --> 00:07:37,919
have to listen to them

163
00:07:36,639 --> 00:07:39,199
but it doesn't mean you have to do

164
00:07:37,919 --> 00:07:40,720
everything they tell you to do or

165
00:07:39,199 --> 00:07:42,000
everything they want you to do

166
00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:43,919
because even though you might want to

167
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:45,520
help them like i said before there might

168
00:07:43,919 --> 00:07:46,639
not be enough money in the budget

169
00:07:45,520 --> 00:07:48,879
or it's just something that it's

170
00:07:46,639 --> 00:07:50,319
completely out of scope so if something

171
00:07:48,879 --> 00:07:52,720
you know someone comes up with this

172
00:07:50,319 --> 00:07:53,360
crazy idea you know i want to go to the

173
00:07:52,720 --> 00:07:54,800
moon

174
00:07:53,360 --> 00:07:57,599
and we can't really accomplish that in

175
00:07:54,800 --> 00:08:00,000
project i'll just put it here as a task

176
00:07:57,599 --> 00:08:01,840
that we'll review later i want to go to

177
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:04,160
the moon

178
00:08:01,840 --> 00:08:05,680
all right so you can say to whoever came

179
00:08:04,160 --> 00:08:06,879
up with that idea we'll look at how we

180
00:08:05,680 --> 00:08:08,800
can get to the moon later

181
00:08:06,879 --> 00:08:10,080
it's not right now in the project scope

182
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:10,479
but i'm going to take note of that and

183
00:08:10,080 --> 00:08:11,919
you

184
00:08:10,479 --> 00:08:14,000
will have visibility right here in your

185
00:08:11,919 --> 00:08:15,360
trello and

186
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:17,199
this is just an example like i was

187
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:18,800
saying of how you can manage a project

188
00:08:17,199 --> 00:08:20,319
in trello and i'll walk you through some

189
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:22,000
other ones so let's let's just continue

190
00:08:20,319 --> 00:08:24,240
with this one so like i said to do

191
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:25,120
doing qa done and this is what we call

192
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:27,280
an agile

193
00:08:25,120 --> 00:08:28,400
a kanban board so you can put here your

194
00:08:27,280 --> 00:08:30,560
user stories

195
00:08:28,400 --> 00:08:32,399
in agile we would say a user story is

196
00:08:30,560 --> 00:08:35,760
kind of like a task but you say

197
00:08:32,399 --> 00:08:39,120
as a role i need to do

198
00:08:35,760 --> 00:08:40,399
blah so that blah right so for example

199
00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:43,519
as a project manager

200
00:08:40,399 --> 00:08:44,320
i need to create the project schedule so

201
00:08:43,519 --> 00:08:45,839
that we can

202
00:08:44,320 --> 00:08:48,320
confirm all the tasks that need to be

203
00:08:45,839 --> 00:08:50,160
done in the project that's a mouthful

204
00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:51,360
right it's really long so in general

205
00:08:50,160 --> 00:08:52,240
you're going to notice that people that

206
00:08:51,360 --> 00:08:54,320
work in agile

207
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:55,920
don't really follow the full template of

208
00:08:54,320 --> 00:08:56,800
a user story and they just write it down

209
00:08:55,920 --> 00:08:58,320
as a task

210
00:08:56,800 --> 00:08:59,760
and what i normally recommend people

211
00:08:58,320 --> 00:09:01,040
working on projects is that they keep it

212
00:08:59,760 --> 00:09:02,880
really short because you know people

213
00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:04,720
don't want to read these long things

214
00:09:02,880 --> 00:09:06,320
and that they just put it in in verb

215
00:09:04,720 --> 00:09:08,000
tense so you should start

216
00:09:06,320 --> 00:09:09,600
because you're it's actually an action

217
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:11,760
right we want to control what people are

218
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:14,000
doing or what we are doing ourselves

219
00:09:11,760 --> 00:09:15,920
so it should start with a verb because a

220
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:17,839
verb denotes action right so

221
00:09:15,920 --> 00:09:18,959
let's say here i i we're talking about

222
00:09:17,839 --> 00:09:22,160
the schedule so

223
00:09:18,959 --> 00:09:26,160
create project

224
00:09:22,160 --> 00:09:30,880
schedule right i also need to

225
00:09:26,160 --> 00:09:30,880
create the project budget

226
00:09:32,640 --> 00:09:36,160
right i don't know let's say this is an

227
00:09:34,399 --> 00:09:38,399
application and we're working on

228
00:09:36,160 --> 00:09:39,760
some mock-ups right so we can over here

229
00:09:38,399 --> 00:09:43,120
develop

230
00:09:39,760 --> 00:09:47,440
initial design

231
00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:51,279
for the app right

232
00:09:47,440 --> 00:09:54,560
and i don't know create

233
00:09:51,279 --> 00:09:57,040
alpha image uh

234
00:09:54,560 --> 00:09:57,680
let's edit that because i forgot the e

235
00:09:57,040 --> 00:09:59,440
all right

236
00:09:57,680 --> 00:10:01,680
it's really easy as you can see really

237
00:09:59,440 --> 00:10:03,040
really quick and if you go to each of

238
00:10:01,680 --> 00:10:04,880
these for example

239
00:10:03,040 --> 00:10:06,320
create project schedule i'm going to

240
00:10:04,880 --> 00:10:07,120
assign that to myself so i'm going to

241
00:10:06,320 --> 00:10:08,720
say

242
00:10:07,120 --> 00:10:11,360
maurice is going to be working on that

243
00:10:08,720 --> 00:10:14,160
task i'll put him on that

244
00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:16,800
and i'm also going to say he needs to

245
00:10:14,160 --> 00:10:16,800
finish this

246
00:10:17,040 --> 00:10:22,640
by next week on tuesday and

247
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:24,640
save so here's the due date already

248
00:10:22,640 --> 00:10:25,120
there and i can create a label and i can

249
00:10:24,640 --> 00:10:26,399
say

250
00:10:25,120 --> 00:10:27,920
you know this is part of the planning

251
00:10:26,399 --> 00:10:29,360
phase of the project so i'm going to say

252
00:10:27,920 --> 00:10:32,320
this is planning

253
00:10:29,360 --> 00:10:33,519
and done and i'm gonna mark that

254
00:10:32,320 --> 00:10:35,600
planning phase with

255
00:10:33,519 --> 00:10:37,519
blue this actually let's play with

256
00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:39,680
yellow i'm gonna put it with yellow

257
00:10:37,519 --> 00:10:41,040
create done so now i know this part of

258
00:10:39,680 --> 00:10:42,560
the planning phase of the project i know

259
00:10:41,040 --> 00:10:43,839
maurice is working on it i know when he

260
00:10:42,560 --> 00:10:46,160
needs to complete it

261
00:10:43,839 --> 00:10:47,600
and i can add some notes for myself or i

262
00:10:46,160 --> 00:10:49,120
can other people can add notes here

263
00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:50,800
right it's kind of like a

264
00:10:49,120 --> 00:10:51,760
social media feed you know where you

265
00:10:50,800 --> 00:10:54,000
different people can join the

266
00:10:51,760 --> 00:10:58,839
conversation so i can put here

267
00:10:54,000 --> 00:11:01,279
for example a note for myself

268
00:10:58,839 --> 00:11:03,920
include two weeks for

269
00:11:01,279 --> 00:11:03,920
detailed

270
00:11:04,480 --> 00:11:11,120
planning in project

271
00:11:07,519 --> 00:11:12,480
schedule right and done

272
00:11:11,120 --> 00:11:14,720
and i can leave the comment there i can

273
00:11:12,480 --> 00:11:16,240
even edit it i can delete it it's really

274
00:11:14,720 --> 00:11:17,760
awesome i love this tool like i said

275
00:11:16,240 --> 00:11:18,560
it's really easy to use it's really

276
00:11:17,760 --> 00:11:19,680
intuitive

277
00:11:18,560 --> 00:11:21,760
i don't have any other people in the

278
00:11:19,680 --> 00:11:23,279
project yet but if i had other people

279
00:11:21,760 --> 00:11:25,279
invited to the project i could just

280
00:11:23,279 --> 00:11:26,880
select them from here and how do you

281
00:11:25,279 --> 00:11:28,000
invite other people well if you recall

282
00:11:26,880 --> 00:11:30,880
there was this menu that i

283
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:31,680
hid so if i unhide it i can set here add

284
00:11:30,880 --> 00:11:32,800
members

285
00:11:31,680 --> 00:11:34,560
and then i can just add their email

286
00:11:32,800 --> 00:11:36,079
address and send them an invite and

287
00:11:34,560 --> 00:11:37,200
because trello is free

288
00:11:36,079 --> 00:11:38,399
they don't need to pay anything they can

289
00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:39,760
start using it and there's a lot of

290
00:11:38,399 --> 00:11:41,839
other things here

291
00:11:39,760 --> 00:11:43,040
you can see you know the latest activity

292
00:11:41,839 --> 00:11:43,760
of everyone that's working on the

293
00:11:43,040 --> 00:11:45,440
project

294
00:11:43,760 --> 00:11:47,440
and so like i said yeah trello is is

295
00:11:45,440 --> 00:11:47,839
really awesome i really recommend it

296
00:11:47,440 --> 00:11:49,279
i've

297
00:11:47,839 --> 00:11:50,720
used it on multiple projects i'm not

298
00:11:49,279 --> 00:11:52,240
going to say you need to use this for

299
00:11:50,720 --> 00:11:52,720
every project but it's a really good

300
00:11:52,240 --> 00:11:54,880
tool

301
00:11:52,720 --> 00:11:56,079
it's a free tool and for being a free

302
00:11:54,880 --> 00:11:58,639
tool it's just

303
00:11:56,079 --> 00:11:59,920
really powerful and let's say this is

304
00:11:58,639 --> 00:12:00,320
doing it's something i'm working right

305
00:11:59,920 --> 00:12:02,160
now

306
00:12:00,320 --> 00:12:04,240
you know and so i just put it here if

307
00:12:02,160 --> 00:12:05,760
it's under qa i sent it to my manager

308
00:12:04,240 --> 00:12:07,360
for him to review

309
00:12:05,760 --> 00:12:09,360
so i can put it then qa you know a few

310
00:12:07,360 --> 00:12:10,560
days later i'll just go here and this is

311
00:12:09,360 --> 00:12:12,800
now

312
00:12:10,560 --> 00:12:14,079
under or i can add a note for myself or

313
00:12:12,800 --> 00:12:15,279
for anyone in the team to look at

314
00:12:14,079 --> 00:12:16,720
the review with management you know

315
00:12:15,279 --> 00:12:17,279
they're looking at the the project

316
00:12:16,720 --> 00:12:18,240
schedule

317
00:12:17,279 --> 00:12:20,000
and they're going to tell us in a few

318
00:12:18,240 --> 00:12:21,440
days if it's approved and when they

319
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:23,440
approve it i can just say done you know

320
00:12:21,440 --> 00:12:26,000
we finished the project schedule

321
00:12:23,440 --> 00:12:27,920
and let's say the budget you know this

322
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:29,440
is also part of planning

323
00:12:27,920 --> 00:12:30,880
but you could create more labels as well

324
00:12:29,440 --> 00:12:32,480
like i was saying let's say we want to

325
00:12:30,880 --> 00:12:34,480
create another label

326
00:12:32,480 --> 00:12:36,620
creating a label and we're going to say

327
00:12:34,480 --> 00:12:37,760
this is part of implementation

328
00:12:36,620 --> 00:12:39,200
[Music]

329
00:12:37,760 --> 00:12:40,880
and we're going to mark that with this

330
00:12:39,200 --> 00:12:44,160
uh red color here

331
00:12:40,880 --> 00:12:46,240
right done done

332
00:12:44,160 --> 00:12:47,279
uh actually create a project this one is

333
00:12:46,240 --> 00:12:48,720
not part of

334
00:12:47,279 --> 00:12:50,639
implementation so i'm going to take it

335
00:12:48,720 --> 00:12:52,000
out take it out this is not part of

336
00:12:50,639 --> 00:12:53,279
implementation create a project budget

337
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:54,880
that's the planning phase

338
00:12:53,279 --> 00:12:56,639
but let's say this create alpha mid

339
00:12:54,880 --> 00:12:57,200
image is part of implementation so i can

340
00:12:56,639 --> 00:13:01,519
add

341
00:12:57,200 --> 00:13:03,519
the label here and that's pretty much it

342
00:13:01,519 --> 00:13:06,399
but check out this really cool feature

343
00:13:03,519 --> 00:13:08,399
about this as well you can go here and

344
00:13:06,399 --> 00:13:11,120
you can filter what people are working

345
00:13:08,399 --> 00:13:14,160
on and i want to filter by

346
00:13:11,120 --> 00:13:16,720
the planning phase so i can see

347
00:13:14,160 --> 00:13:17,680
which tasks are planning or i could

348
00:13:16,720 --> 00:13:19,040
filter by

349
00:13:17,680 --> 00:13:21,200
you know let's remove this one and let's

350
00:13:19,040 --> 00:13:24,480
filter by mauricio

351
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:26,320
what's he doing just working on one task

352
00:13:24,480 --> 00:13:27,760
that's a very very basic example like i

353
00:13:26,320 --> 00:13:29,360
said you can you can add a lot of other

354
00:13:27,760 --> 00:13:30,480
things i'm going to remove the filter

355
00:13:29,360 --> 00:13:32,320
see all the tasks i'm not going to put

356
00:13:30,480 --> 00:13:33,839
here a lot of other tasks but you get

357
00:13:32,320 --> 00:13:35,600
the idea you get the picture

358
00:13:33,839 --> 00:13:37,279
so i'm going to go here to my main board

359
00:13:35,600 --> 00:13:38,240
trello and i'm going to create another

360
00:13:37,279 --> 00:13:40,320
project

361
00:13:38,240 --> 00:13:41,600
not a team but another project you can

362
00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:43,519
separate also

363
00:13:41,600 --> 00:13:45,199
your different projects by teams by

364
00:13:43,519 --> 00:13:46,160
using this functionality

365
00:13:45,199 --> 00:13:49,199
and let's say i'm going to create

366
00:13:46,160 --> 00:13:53,680
another project

367
00:13:49,199 --> 00:13:57,360
project example 2

368
00:13:53,680 --> 00:13:58,720
right so here's a thought about another

369
00:13:57,360 --> 00:13:59,680
way you can use trello let's say you

370
00:13:58,720 --> 00:14:01,600
want to put here

371
00:13:59,680 --> 00:14:05,040
your project faces and let's talk about

372
00:14:01,600 --> 00:14:05,040
so we talked about discovery

373
00:14:05,279 --> 00:14:13,839
planning implementation

374
00:14:10,800 --> 00:14:15,440
and closure and you can start writing

375
00:14:13,839 --> 00:14:16,399
here all the tasks that are part of each

376
00:14:15,440 --> 00:14:17,920
of the phases

377
00:14:16,399 --> 00:14:19,839
and this is another way you can use

378
00:14:17,920 --> 00:14:22,000
trello like i said it's just

379
00:14:19,839 --> 00:14:24,560
open for your creativity and innovation

380
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:27,680
in the way how you want to use it and

381
00:14:24,560 --> 00:14:30,399
let's go to another example again create

382
00:14:27,680 --> 00:14:33,920
another one here

383
00:14:30,399 --> 00:14:35,519
project example three

384
00:14:33,920 --> 00:14:37,600
and in this project example three i'm

385
00:14:35,519 --> 00:14:39,519
gonna put here for the task for

386
00:14:37,600 --> 00:14:41,680
each person so i'm gonna say here

387
00:14:39,519 --> 00:14:44,800
mauricio we have here

388
00:14:41,680 --> 00:14:50,160
michael what he's working on michelle

389
00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:50,160
robbie and charlie

390
00:14:51,600 --> 00:14:54,959
and so everyone it's another this is

391
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:56,240
another way you can use

392
00:14:54,959 --> 00:14:58,240
uh trello to manage your project so you

393
00:14:56,240 --> 00:15:00,000
can put a board for each one

394
00:14:58,240 --> 00:15:01,839
you know a group of lists or tasks for

395
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:03,519
each one so they can either their tasks

396
00:15:01,839 --> 00:15:05,120
here or you can add it for them

397
00:15:03,519 --> 00:15:06,720
and then when they're finished you can

398
00:15:05,120 --> 00:15:08,240
just move them to done

399
00:15:06,720 --> 00:15:09,920
you know you can just tell your

400
00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:10,880
teammates hey michelle you know when you

401
00:15:09,920 --> 00:15:13,839
finish

402
00:15:10,880 --> 00:15:13,839
those designs

403
00:15:14,560 --> 00:15:17,600
just move them to done and they can do

404
00:15:16,079 --> 00:15:18,240
that themselves or you can do it for

405
00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:19,680
them

406
00:15:18,240 --> 00:15:21,440
and this is the beauty of it this is

407
00:15:19,680 --> 00:15:22,800
trello like i said it's it's really easy

408
00:15:21,440 --> 00:15:24,560
to use it's amazing

409
00:15:22,800 --> 00:15:26,560
and i definitely recommend it as a one

410
00:15:24,560 --> 00:15:28,320
of the key project management tools

411
00:15:26,560 --> 00:15:30,800
which you can use

412
00:15:28,320 --> 00:15:32,240
alright guys i'm gonna leave you with

413
00:15:30,800 --> 00:15:33,360
that one but i'll talk about some other

414
00:15:32,240 --> 00:15:38,560
