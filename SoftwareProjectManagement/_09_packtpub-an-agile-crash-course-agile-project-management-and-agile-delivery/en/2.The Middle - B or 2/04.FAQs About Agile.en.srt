1
00:00:00,799 --> 00:00:05,040
so let's go over some of the typical and

2
00:00:02,879 --> 00:00:06,799
frequently asked questions about agile

3
00:00:05,040 --> 00:00:08,400
i've been doing agile for many years now

4
00:00:06,799 --> 00:00:09,040
and i've worked with agile across many

5
00:00:08,400 --> 00:00:10,240
industries

6
00:00:09,040 --> 00:00:12,400
many projects and different

7
00:00:10,240 --> 00:00:13,200
organizations i've also worked with

8
00:00:12,400 --> 00:00:15,440
different teams

9
00:00:13,200 --> 00:00:16,320
different team sizes and different

10
00:00:15,440 --> 00:00:18,640
applications

11
00:00:16,320 --> 00:00:20,160
right so let's talk about some of those

12
00:00:18,640 --> 00:00:21,520
common questions that i get all the time

13
00:00:20,160 --> 00:00:22,880
because people ask me these questions

14
00:00:21,520 --> 00:00:23,840
and i know you might have some of those

15
00:00:22,880 --> 00:00:25,680
questions so i thought

16
00:00:23,840 --> 00:00:27,760
maybe we should just go over them right

17
00:00:25,680 --> 00:00:28,960
so one of those questions is is agile

18
00:00:27,760 --> 00:00:31,279
only for developers

19
00:00:28,960 --> 00:00:32,640
and only for project managers and the

20
00:00:31,279 --> 00:00:34,880
answer to that question is no

21
00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:36,239
agile isn't only for developers nor just

22
00:00:34,880 --> 00:00:38,559
for project managers

23
00:00:36,239 --> 00:00:40,079
there's people using agile across very

24
00:00:38,559 --> 00:00:41,200
different industries and across very

25
00:00:40,079 --> 00:00:43,280
different projects

26
00:00:41,200 --> 00:00:44,480
and people in very different roles

27
00:00:43,280 --> 00:00:46,800
working with agile

28
00:00:44,480 --> 00:00:48,079
so you have you know testers you have

29
00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:50,079
business analysts you have

30
00:00:48,079 --> 00:00:51,120
architects you have you know people

31
00:00:50,079 --> 00:00:53,199
working in finance

32
00:00:51,120 --> 00:00:54,960
in hr in sales in operations in

33
00:00:53,199 --> 00:00:57,280
procurement in marketing

34
00:00:54,960 --> 00:00:58,160
so pretty much anyone can apply agile to

35
00:00:57,280 --> 00:01:00,079
their projects

36
00:00:58,160 --> 00:01:01,680
as long as they understand how it works

37
00:01:00,079 --> 00:01:03,280
and how to apply it

38
00:01:01,680 --> 00:01:04,799
now i'm not going to say agile is suited

39
00:01:03,280 --> 00:01:06,080
for every type of project because that's

40
00:01:04,799 --> 00:01:07,760
a different question

41
00:01:06,080 --> 00:01:09,360
but agile is certainly suited for the

42
00:01:07,760 --> 00:01:11,280
vast majority of projects

43
00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:13,040
so if you want to do something that you

44
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:14,479
want to deliver quickly deliver

45
00:01:13,040 --> 00:01:16,560
often and you want to work

46
00:01:14,479 --> 00:01:18,159
collaboratively then you're probably

47
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:20,159
suited for agile if you're an

48
00:01:18,159 --> 00:01:21,360
organization that has flexibility and

49
00:01:20,159 --> 00:01:23,119
allows you to go

50
00:01:21,360 --> 00:01:24,960
empowered and do some work and do it

51
00:01:23,119 --> 00:01:26,080
quickly then your project is probably

52
00:01:24,960 --> 00:01:27,360
suited for agile

53
00:01:26,080 --> 00:01:29,360
but if you're working in a place where

54
00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:31,920
there's a lot of bureaucracy you know

55
00:01:29,360 --> 00:01:33,680
you need things very documented things

56
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:35,520
have to take long times there's long

57
00:01:33,680 --> 00:01:38,000
lead times there's a lot of approvals

58
00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:39,040
you know very very robust and structured

59
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:41,200
processes and

60
00:01:39,040 --> 00:01:42,479
you know this type of organization is

61
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:43,520
probably a little bit harder to

62
00:01:42,479 --> 00:01:45,520
implement agile

63
00:01:43,520 --> 00:01:47,759
and on occasions it might be if the

64
00:01:45,520 --> 00:01:49,600
project you know is very very big and if

65
00:01:47,759 --> 00:01:51,200
you're you're meant to deliver it over a

66
00:01:49,600 --> 00:01:52,799
couple of years then it's probably not

67
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:54,000
an agile project and it's more of a

68
00:01:52,799 --> 00:01:55,280
waterfall project

69
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,560
but if you're working on something that

70
00:01:55,280 --> 00:01:57,680
you want to deliver quick you want to

71
00:01:56,560 --> 00:01:59,200
deliver often

72
00:01:57,680 --> 00:02:00,799
you want to have close interaction with

73
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:02,479
your customers

74
00:02:00,799 --> 00:02:03,840
the business owners want to have provide

75
00:02:02,479 --> 00:02:06,000
input and they want to provide income

76
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:07,360
input constantly to the process they

77
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,399
want to see what you're doing they want

78
00:02:07,360 --> 00:02:09,840
to get something

79
00:02:08,399 --> 00:02:11,520
delivered to them and they want to see

80
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:14,000
iterations of that project

81
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:14,640
then your project is suited for agile so

82
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,319
like i said

83
00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:17,840
agile can be applied to very different

84
00:02:16,319 --> 00:02:18,959
industries very different type of

85
00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:21,360
projects

86
00:02:18,959 --> 00:02:23,360
across many many many disciplines i mean

87
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:25,599
i've worked personally on agile on you

88
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:27,120
know sales projects procurement projects

89
00:02:25,599 --> 00:02:29,200
operations projects

90
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:30,400
and technology projects and of course

91
00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:32,319
agile works

92
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:33,599
great in technology because well it was

93
00:02:32,319 --> 00:02:35,599
born in technology

94
00:02:33,599 --> 00:02:37,440
but please don't go with the

95
00:02:35,599 --> 00:02:38,640
misconception that agile is just for

96
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:40,560
technology it isn't

97
00:02:38,640 --> 00:02:42,000
right you can apply agile to other type

98
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:44,160
of projects and other type of

99
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:46,239
of industries so another question that

100
00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:47,920
comes up when working with agile is

101
00:02:46,239 --> 00:02:49,519
people when they haven't worked with

102
00:02:47,920 --> 00:02:51,120
agile they kind of have this

103
00:02:49,519 --> 00:02:52,800
thought at the back of their mind like

104
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:54,480
is agile hard you know is

105
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:56,080
is agile really really difficult you

106
00:02:54,480 --> 00:02:56,640
know do i need to be a rocket science to

107
00:02:56,080 --> 00:02:58,879
do

108
00:02:56,640 --> 00:03:00,640
scientists to do agile and the answer to

109
00:02:58,879 --> 00:03:02,239
that question again is no

110
00:03:00,640 --> 00:03:03,680
agile is not really for rocket

111
00:03:02,239 --> 00:03:04,000
scientists you know it's not really just

112
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:06,159
for

113
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:07,760
developers or really techie people

114
00:03:06,159 --> 00:03:09,120
anyone can do agile you know

115
00:03:07,760 --> 00:03:10,879
and that's why i created this course so

116
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:12,879
you can learn about agile and you can

117
00:03:10,879 --> 00:03:13,360
learn how to apply it to your projects

118
00:03:12,879 --> 00:03:14,879
and

119
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:16,800
even to your personal projects you know

120
00:03:14,879 --> 00:03:18,000
there's people using agile to plan

121
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:20,480
weddings and there's nothing wrong

122
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:22,400
with that there's people using agile to

123
00:03:20,480 --> 00:03:24,319
shop their groceries every week

124
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:25,840
or to organize their house and how they

125
00:03:24,319 --> 00:03:27,519
do things with their family

126
00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:29,120
and that's fine you know there's so many

127
00:03:27,519 --> 00:03:31,920
tools out there that you can

128
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:33,519
use to implement your agile projects and

129
00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:34,799
work with them collaboratively with

130
00:03:33,519 --> 00:03:37,040
different people

131
00:03:34,799 --> 00:03:38,959
so another question that comes up very

132
00:03:37,040 --> 00:03:41,040
often when you're doing agile is

133
00:03:38,959 --> 00:03:43,519
is agile you know like is it going to

134
00:03:41,040 --> 00:03:45,360
change everything is it going to solve

135
00:03:43,519 --> 00:03:46,560
everything it's not going to change

136
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:47,760
everything it's not going to solve

137
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:50,799
everything of course not

138
00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:53,200
you know agile is not perfect agile is a

139
00:03:50,799 --> 00:03:54,000
tool and a process which you can use to

140
00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:55,599
enhance

141
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:57,120
the way you deliver projects products

142
00:03:55,599 --> 00:03:58,879
and services to your clients

143
00:03:57,120 --> 00:04:00,480
but that doesn't mean that you know

144
00:03:58,879 --> 00:04:01,599
everything else isn't important and you

145
00:04:00,480 --> 00:04:03,040
should get rid of everything else that

146
00:04:01,599 --> 00:04:05,200
you're doing of course not

147
00:04:03,040 --> 00:04:06,400
you can incorporate that into agile and

148
00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:08,080
work

149
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:09,599
work together with those things to

150
00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:12,319
better deliver your projects

151
00:04:09,599 --> 00:04:12,879
but agile you know the beauty of agile

152
00:04:12,319 --> 00:04:15,360
is that

153
00:04:12,879 --> 00:04:16,239
it focuses on simplicity it focuses on

154
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:19,600
doing things

155
00:04:16,239 --> 00:04:21,759
quickly and often and it focuses on

156
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:23,280
working collaboratively with your team

157
00:04:21,759 --> 00:04:24,880
and with your business owners and

158
00:04:23,280 --> 00:04:26,479
stakeholders

159
00:04:24,880 --> 00:04:28,000
so that they are constantly involved

160
00:04:26,479 --> 00:04:28,720
with the outcome with what you are

161
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,479
delivering

162
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:31,919
so in other words just what you think

163
00:04:30,479 --> 00:04:32,560
you're delivering but what you will

164
00:04:31,919 --> 00:04:35,040
deliver

165
00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:36,080
and at the same time agile provides and

166
00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:38,400
is open

167
00:04:36,080 --> 00:04:40,000
you know for scope variation and allows

168
00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:40,400
you to incorporate new things that come

169
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,080
up

170
00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:43,440
so in traditional project management you

171
00:04:42,080 --> 00:04:44,080
know something new comes up and you'd be

172
00:04:43,440 --> 00:04:46,320
like ah

173
00:04:44,080 --> 00:04:48,240
no no no actually you know we already

174
00:04:46,320 --> 00:04:48,639
talked about that you signed off on that

175
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:50,080
and

176
00:04:48,639 --> 00:04:51,680
and we really we you know we're really

177
00:04:50,080 --> 00:04:52,560
in an advanced stage of the project we

178
00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:54,160
really can't make

179
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:55,840
any changes it's gonna you know derail

180
00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:57,440
the project that's

181
00:04:55,840 --> 00:04:59,520
completely out of scope of the project

182
00:04:57,440 --> 00:05:00,960
and so forth right in natural you would

183
00:04:59,520 --> 00:05:02,160
never say that you would actually

184
00:05:00,960 --> 00:05:04,320
welcome changes

185
00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:05,440
and include them in your project and

186
00:05:04,320 --> 00:05:07,840
enhance

187
00:05:05,440 --> 00:05:11,280
adapt and be flexible to what your

188
00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:11,280
customers are asking for
