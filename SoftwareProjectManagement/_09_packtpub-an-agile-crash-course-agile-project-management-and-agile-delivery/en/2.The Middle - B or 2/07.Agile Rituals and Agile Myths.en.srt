1
00:00:00,719 --> 00:00:05,520
now let's go over the agile rituals

2
00:00:03,679 --> 00:00:07,759
what you need to understand here is that

3
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:09,599
agile is more than just a methodology or

4
00:00:07,759 --> 00:00:12,559
a way of doing things

5
00:00:09,599 --> 00:00:13,519
it's actually more like a culture unlike

6
00:00:12,559 --> 00:00:15,120
in any culture

7
00:00:13,519 --> 00:00:16,960
there are rituals or things you should

8
00:00:15,120 --> 00:00:19,439
do in agile

9
00:00:16,960 --> 00:00:20,560
you have four main rituals sprint

10
00:00:19,439 --> 00:00:23,039
planning

11
00:00:20,560 --> 00:00:23,920
daily stand-ups sprint review or demo

12
00:00:23,039 --> 00:00:26,960
sessions

13
00:00:23,920 --> 00:00:29,039
and retrospectives all are important and

14
00:00:26,960 --> 00:00:31,359
all contribute to an agile environment

15
00:00:29,039 --> 00:00:32,239
and culture let's start with sprint

16
00:00:31,359 --> 00:00:33,920
planning

17
00:00:32,239 --> 00:00:35,360
in the sprint planning meeting the team

18
00:00:33,920 --> 00:00:37,360
gets together and defines

19
00:00:35,360 --> 00:00:39,040
which user stories they will work on

20
00:00:37,360 --> 00:00:40,960
over the next two weeks

21
00:00:39,040 --> 00:00:42,960
so in this session you are reviewing as

22
00:00:40,960 --> 00:00:45,120
a team the scope of work

23
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:47,360
priorities and what you believe is

24
00:00:45,120 --> 00:00:49,200
achievable during the next sprint

25
00:00:47,360 --> 00:00:51,840
the scrum master facilitates this

26
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:53,680
meeting but everyone participates

27
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:55,680
during sprint planning the team reviews

28
00:00:53,680 --> 00:00:56,559
the backlog and picks the user stories

29
00:00:55,680 --> 00:00:59,600
they will work on

30
00:00:56,559 --> 00:01:01,440
over the next sprint and typically teams

31
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:03,840
will place the selected user stories in

32
00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:05,760
their kanban board under to do

33
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:07,280
as they are planning for the next print

34
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:10,159
and getting ready

35
00:01:07,280 --> 00:01:12,240
daily standups as their name indicates

36
00:01:10,159 --> 00:01:12,720
are called standups because the concept

37
00:01:12,240 --> 00:01:14,240
is

38
00:01:12,720 --> 00:01:16,400
that everyone should be standing up

39
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:16,960
during the meeting the concept behind

40
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:18,960
this

41
00:01:16,960 --> 00:01:20,240
is that by standing up it helps ensure

42
00:01:18,960 --> 00:01:23,119
the meeting is short

43
00:01:20,240 --> 00:01:24,960
focused and productive daily stand-ups

44
00:01:23,119 --> 00:01:27,520
have a sense of informality

45
00:01:24,960 --> 00:01:29,360
and they function like a round table

46
00:01:27,520 --> 00:01:30,479
everyone on the team says what they did

47
00:01:29,360 --> 00:01:32,799
the day before

48
00:01:30,479 --> 00:01:34,079
what they will do today and if they have

49
00:01:32,799 --> 00:01:36,159
any impediments

50
00:01:34,079 --> 00:01:37,920
issues or anything they need support

51
00:01:36,159 --> 00:01:40,240
with like before

52
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:41,840
the scrum master facilitates meeting and

53
00:01:40,240 --> 00:01:42,880
listens with special attention for

54
00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:45,439
impediments

55
00:01:42,880 --> 00:01:47,520
since it is his job to remove them

56
00:01:45,439 --> 00:01:49,439
sprint reviews or demo sessions

57
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:51,360
showcase are meetings where the team

58
00:01:49,439 --> 00:01:53,360
gets together to review what was

59
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:55,119
delivered in the last sprint

60
00:01:53,360 --> 00:01:56,719
so this is scheduled right after the

61
00:01:55,119 --> 00:01:59,040
sprint finishes

62
00:01:56,719 --> 00:02:01,439
and during the meeting the team goes

63
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:04,560
over user storage which were delivered

64
00:02:01,439 --> 00:02:05,439
and the ones which weren't if any not to

65
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:07,680
the point

66
00:02:05,439 --> 00:02:09,520
of going over who is guilty for not

67
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:12,480
delivering or pointing fingers

68
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:13,920
but to learn and adapt and more for the

69
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:16,480
team's reflection

70
00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:18,239
sprint reviews are generally internal

71
00:02:16,480 --> 00:02:20,480
with everyone on the team

72
00:02:18,239 --> 00:02:22,560
but sometimes people include the product

73
00:02:20,480 --> 00:02:25,040
owner to review progress

74
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:26,560
in reality this can be done separately

75
00:02:25,040 --> 00:02:28,720
so you can meet internally

76
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:30,800
and afterwards plan for another separate

77
00:02:28,720 --> 00:02:33,040
session with the product owner

78
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:34,640
in agile we would call this a demo or

79
00:02:33,040 --> 00:02:36,400
showcase session

80
00:02:34,640 --> 00:02:38,319
like a lot of things in agile this is up

81
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:39,599
to you and what works best for you and

82
00:02:38,319 --> 00:02:41,840
your team

83
00:02:39,599 --> 00:02:43,360
personally i tend to separate internal

84
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:44,959
meetings from those with the product

85
00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:47,200
owner and stakeholders

86
00:02:44,959 --> 00:02:48,080
but on occasions i do combine both

87
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:50,720
meetings

88
00:02:48,080 --> 00:02:52,319
especially if everyone is really busy

89
00:02:50,720 --> 00:02:53,360
and there isn't too much availability

90
00:02:52,319 --> 00:02:55,280
from team members

91
00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:57,760
or if they are working on multiple

92
00:02:55,280 --> 00:03:00,400
projects and have limited availability

93
00:02:57,760 --> 00:03:01,920
retrospectives are one of my favorite

94
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:03,920
agile rituals

95
00:03:01,920 --> 00:03:05,599
they focus on lessons learned and what

96
00:03:03,920 --> 00:03:07,440
you can do to improve

97
00:03:05,599 --> 00:03:09,680
or what your team should adjust to

98
00:03:07,440 --> 00:03:12,400
improve delivery and execution

99
00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:14,000
it's a moment for reflection this is

100
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:15,680
something you would do in traditional

101
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,480
project management at the end of the

102
00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:18,640
project

103
00:03:16,480 --> 00:03:20,640
and traditionally people would call them

104
00:03:18,640 --> 00:03:23,680
post implementation reviews

105
00:03:20,640 --> 00:03:25,120
pirs or lessons learned so in

106
00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:26,799
traditional project management

107
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:29,280
it could be months before you actually

108
00:03:26,799 --> 00:03:31,680
sit down to discuss lessons learned

109
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:33,120
but in agile you do this constantly

110
00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:35,440
right after a sprint

111
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:37,040
and before your sprint planning session

112
00:03:35,440 --> 00:03:38,879
during a retrospective

113
00:03:37,040 --> 00:03:40,640
you and the team should answer three

114
00:03:38,879 --> 00:03:43,760
basic questions

115
00:03:40,640 --> 00:03:44,400
what went well what didn't and what

116
00:03:43,760 --> 00:03:47,440
should you do

117
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:49,519
differently in the next sprint so

118
00:03:47,440 --> 00:03:51,120
as we've discussed before agile is

119
00:03:49,519 --> 00:03:53,760
iterative and adaptive

120
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:54,720
and retrospectives reflect that too you

121
00:03:53,760 --> 00:03:57,920
deliver

122
00:03:54,720 --> 00:04:01,200
reflect and adjust deliver

123
00:03:57,920 --> 00:04:02,560
reflect and adjust so giving agile is a

124
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:04,319
mystery for a lot of people

125
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:05,680
because they don't know what it is or

126
00:04:04,319 --> 00:04:07,760
don't understand it

127
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:10,080
well there are a lot of myths or

128
00:04:07,760 --> 00:04:12,000
misconceptions around agile

129
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:13,680
and i would like to clarify about all of

130
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:16,320
them so that you don't believe

131
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:18,639
any of them let's start with a very

132
00:04:16,320 --> 00:04:22,160
common misconception about agile

133
00:04:18,639 --> 00:04:22,560
agile is anti-documentation and agile

134
00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:24,960
says

135
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:25,840
we shouldn't document anything

136
00:04:24,960 --> 00:04:29,520
documenting

137
00:04:25,840 --> 00:04:32,320
is worthless completely untrue false

138
00:04:29,520 --> 00:04:32,880
and a huge misconception around agile

139
00:04:32,320 --> 00:04:35,520
agile

140
00:04:32,880 --> 00:04:36,479
has never said we shouldn't document on

141
00:04:35,520 --> 00:04:38,720
the contrary

142
00:04:36,479 --> 00:04:39,520
with agile you are documenting all the

143
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:40,720
time

144
00:04:39,520 --> 00:04:43,120
think about user stories or

145
00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:44,720
retrospectives you are documenting

146
00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:46,800
what agile wants you to understand

147
00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:48,560
though is that you shouldn't spend hours

148
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:51,759
and hours documenting

149
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:53,440
keep it simple and keep it lean i've

150
00:04:51,759 --> 00:04:56,000
also heard a lot of people

151
00:04:53,440 --> 00:04:58,000
especially business analysts say that

152
00:04:56,000 --> 00:05:00,400
agile is anti-planning

153
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:01,440
again nothing could be further from the

154
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:04,160
truth

155
00:05:01,440 --> 00:05:05,280
in agile you are planning all the time

156
00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:07,360
and probably

157
00:05:05,280 --> 00:05:09,680
a lot more often than you would in any

158
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:11,840
other project management methodology

159
00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:13,600
before you start any sprint you will be

160
00:05:11,840 --> 00:05:14,240
doing a short and focused planning

161
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:17,120
session

162
00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:17,919
which in agile is called sprint planning

163
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:18,960
on your screen

164
00:05:17,919 --> 00:05:21,440
you can see a lot of other

165
00:05:18,960 --> 00:05:23,280
misconceptions around agile and i'm not

166
00:05:21,440 --> 00:05:24,400
going to go over each and every one of

167
00:05:23,280 --> 00:05:25,759
them in detail

168
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:27,759
because they're pretty straightforward

169
00:05:25,759 --> 00:05:30,479
and i'm sure you get the picture

170
00:05:27,759 --> 00:05:30,960
but let's go over the last two agile

171
00:05:30,479 --> 00:05:34,479
solves

172
00:05:30,960 --> 00:05:36,160
everything no it doesn't agile is a

173
00:05:34,479 --> 00:05:38,160
framework a methodology

174
00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:39,440
and it can help you with a lot of things

175
00:05:38,160 --> 00:05:41,280
but it's not perfect

176
00:05:39,440 --> 00:05:43,199
and it's not going to save the world or

177
00:05:41,280 --> 00:05:45,600
solve all of your problems

178
00:05:43,199 --> 00:05:46,880
you have to be creative and proactive to

179
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:49,680
solve your problems

180
00:05:46,880 --> 00:05:51,840
you have to act not just to think you

181
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:53,759
have to work with people and together

182
00:05:51,840 --> 00:05:56,160
find the best solution

183
00:05:53,759 --> 00:05:59,039
you have to collaborate research and

184
00:05:56,160 --> 00:06:02,000
benchmark to solve your problems

185
00:05:59,039 --> 00:06:03,520
but like i said before agile will help

186
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:06,639
you in your journey

187
00:06:03,520 --> 00:06:08,479
and finally my personal favorite and one

188
00:06:06,639 --> 00:06:09,039
of the biggest misconceptions around

189
00:06:08,479 --> 00:06:12,960
agile

190
00:06:09,039 --> 00:06:16,479
is that agile is only for i.t projects

191
00:06:12,960 --> 00:06:17,520
no it's not agile was born in the iit

192
00:06:16,479 --> 00:06:19,360
industry

193
00:06:17,520 --> 00:06:22,000
but it is currently used across pretty

194
00:06:19,360 --> 00:06:23,919
