1
00:00:00,560 --> 00:00:04,480
hey guys next i'm going to show you a

2
00:00:03,040 --> 00:00:06,640
real life example

3
00:00:04,480 --> 00:00:08,960
of an agile kanban board for one of my

4
00:00:06,640 --> 00:00:09,920
projects and this is a real-life project

5
00:00:08,960 --> 00:00:12,000
that i worked on

6
00:00:09,920 --> 00:00:13,360
a couple of months ago in this example

7
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:14,160
you're going to see that we had each

8
00:00:13,360 --> 00:00:16,480
team member

9
00:00:14,160 --> 00:00:18,480
with their own set of user stories so we

10
00:00:16,480 --> 00:00:20,240
had the work in progress what we called

11
00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:22,240
in the project in the work in progress

12
00:00:20,240 --> 00:00:23,840
which is basically the same as doing

13
00:00:22,240 --> 00:00:25,199
when we do an agile board and we create

14
00:00:23,840 --> 00:00:27,039
a column called doing

15
00:00:25,199 --> 00:00:29,359
in this case we called it work in

16
00:00:27,039 --> 00:00:29,760
progress and then we had the done at the

17
00:00:29,359 --> 00:00:31,679
end

18
00:00:29,760 --> 00:00:33,360
of the kanban board which is something

19
00:00:31,679 --> 00:00:34,719
that you also have so generally when you

20
00:00:33,360 --> 00:00:37,840
create a kanban board

21
00:00:34,719 --> 00:00:38,640
you have the to-do doing sometimes you

22
00:00:37,840 --> 00:00:40,719
have qa

23
00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:42,879
and and then done whether you have the

24
00:00:40,719 --> 00:00:43,440
qa or not is optional it's up to you as

25
00:00:42,879 --> 00:00:45,680
a team

26
00:00:43,440 --> 00:00:47,760
sometimes some agile projects would just

27
00:00:45,680 --> 00:00:49,520
or some agile teams would just

28
00:00:47,760 --> 00:00:50,960
do it as part of their user story

29
00:00:49,520 --> 00:00:53,360
perform the qa

30
00:00:50,960 --> 00:00:54,800
within the user story and then when they

31
00:00:53,360 --> 00:00:57,440
complete the user story

32
00:00:54,800 --> 00:00:58,160
they would move it to the done so in

33
00:00:57,440 --> 00:00:59,680
this case

34
00:00:58,160 --> 00:01:02,239
because we were working on a project

35
00:00:59,680 --> 00:01:05,040
that was a huge massive project

36
00:01:02,239 --> 00:01:06,960
and because it was so big and it had so

37
00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:09,680
many different streams of work

38
00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:11,040
you had to set up the agile kanban work

39
00:01:09,680 --> 00:01:12,240
a little bit different than what you

40
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:14,640
normally would

41
00:01:12,240 --> 00:01:17,360
but the beauty of this is i can show you

42
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:20,080
how you can adapt agile kanban work

43
00:01:17,360 --> 00:01:21,680
to your real life scenario so like i've

44
00:01:20,080 --> 00:01:24,799
said many times before

45
00:01:21,680 --> 00:01:27,119
agile is very flexible you don't have to

46
00:01:24,799 --> 00:01:28,320
play everything by the book you have to

47
00:01:27,119 --> 00:01:30,240
learn and take

48
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:32,799
what is the best that you can find and

49
00:01:30,240 --> 00:01:35,119
adapt it and adjust it to your real life

50
00:01:32,799 --> 00:01:36,320
project or scenario in our particular

51
00:01:35,119 --> 00:01:37,200
case like you're going to see in a

52
00:01:36,320 --> 00:01:39,360
moment

53
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:41,280
because our backlog was so big and we

54
00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:44,000
had so many things in the to do

55
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:45,520
we actually separated that in our trello

56
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:47,840
in a separate board

57
00:01:45,520 --> 00:01:48,880
to our work in progress and our

58
00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:50,320
completion

59
00:01:48,880 --> 00:01:52,399
and even when we were completing the

60
00:01:50,320 --> 00:01:55,520
work we would move the sprints

61
00:01:52,399 --> 00:01:57,200
to a separate list just because we had

62
00:01:55,520 --> 00:01:58,560
so many sprints we were working on right

63
00:01:57,200 --> 00:02:00,880
so we were working on

64
00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:02,000
monthly sprints in this case and we did

65
00:02:00,880 --> 00:02:04,079
that just to make it

66
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:06,560
easier for us as a team to control the

67
00:02:04,079 --> 00:02:08,800
timing and the work that we were doing

68
00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:09,599
so basically we set up each sprint

69
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:12,319
exactly

70
00:02:09,599 --> 00:02:12,959
as per the calendar month of each month

71
00:02:12,319 --> 00:02:14,720
so

72
00:02:12,959 --> 00:02:17,040
basically we're talking about four-week

73
00:02:14,720 --> 00:02:19,440
sprints right and in our case

74
00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:20,879
in this particular project that made a

75
00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:22,800
lot more sense for us

76
00:02:20,879 --> 00:02:24,879
because we're working on huge

77
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:26,239
initiatives and we needed a little bit

78
00:02:24,879 --> 00:02:28,400
more time to complete

79
00:02:26,239 --> 00:02:30,319
our sprints as you already know you

80
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:32,800
don't have to do four-week sprints

81
00:02:30,319 --> 00:02:34,959
generally sprints are two weeks but some

82
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:37,040
agile teams do three or four

83
00:02:34,959 --> 00:02:39,360
it's entirely up to the agile team and

84
00:02:37,040 --> 00:02:41,599
to their particular scenario to decide

85
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:43,840
which sprint duration works best for

86
00:02:41,599 --> 00:02:45,440
them like i said in our example

87
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:48,400
we chose four weeks because we're

88
00:02:45,440 --> 00:02:51,760
working a massive massive project

89
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:52,720
over multiple sprints multiple streams

90
00:02:51,760 --> 00:02:54,560
of work

91
00:02:52,720 --> 00:02:55,920
multiple stakeholders and different

92
00:02:54,560 --> 00:02:59,040
areas of the business

93
00:02:55,920 --> 00:03:01,200
so this particular adaptation of the

94
00:02:59,040 --> 00:03:01,760
kanban board to our particular business

95
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:04,000
need

96
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:04,879
made a lot of sense for us and it worked

97
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:07,040
quite well

98
00:03:04,879 --> 00:03:08,080
as you'll see in the example we had all

99
00:03:07,040 --> 00:03:10,560
the user stories

100
00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:11,440
each team member was working on we had

101
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:14,159
our

102
00:03:11,440 --> 00:03:15,120
done our completed sprint list of user

103
00:03:14,159 --> 00:03:17,680
stories

104
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:18,560
and we had a separate backlog and a

105
00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:20,480
separate

106
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:22,400
list of everything that we had completed

107
00:03:20,480 --> 00:03:24,239
for all of our previous sprints

108
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:25,920
so it worked really well for us because

109
00:03:24,239 --> 00:03:28,799
we could reference the work

110
00:03:25,920 --> 00:03:30,640
back really easily we could also assign

111
00:03:28,799 --> 00:03:32,640
story points we could also look at our

112
00:03:30,640 --> 00:03:34,319
velocity and how we're progressing

113
00:03:32,640 --> 00:03:36,000
and this also helped us when we're doing

114
00:03:34,319 --> 00:03:38,480
our retrospectives and looking

115
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:39,360
at what we had accomplished and how we

116
00:03:38,480 --> 00:03:41,519
had done

117
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:43,440
in that particular sprint so without

118
00:03:41,519 --> 00:03:45,440
further ado let me take you right now to

119
00:03:43,440 --> 00:03:47,599
the example we just discussed

120
00:03:45,440 --> 00:03:48,480
and you'll be able to identify and see

121
00:03:47,599 --> 00:03:51,680
their

122
00:03:48,480 --> 00:03:53,120
real life examples of what we've learned

123
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:54,799
so far in the course

124
00:03:53,120 --> 00:04:01,840
i hope you enjoy it and i hope you make

125
00:03:54,799 --> 00:04:01,840
the best of it cheers

[Music]

127
00:04:54,840 --> 00:05:29,199
so

128
00:04:55,920 --> 00:05:29,199
[Music]

129
00:05:31,510 --> 00:06:28,560
[Music]

130
00:06:26,479 --> 00:06:28,560
