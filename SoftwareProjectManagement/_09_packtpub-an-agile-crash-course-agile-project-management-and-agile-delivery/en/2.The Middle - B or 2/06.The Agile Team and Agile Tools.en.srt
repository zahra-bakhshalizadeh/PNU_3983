1
00:00:00,640 --> 00:00:04,000
in agile a team basically has three main

2
00:00:03,199 --> 00:00:06,960
roles

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:08,559
the product owner the scrum master and

4
00:00:06,960 --> 00:00:11,120
the delivery team

5
00:00:08,559 --> 00:00:12,080
and most people fall within the delivery

6
00:00:11,120 --> 00:00:14,480
team

7
00:00:12,080 --> 00:00:17,199
the product owner is the end customer or

8
00:00:14,480 --> 00:00:19,279
a person who represents the end customer

9
00:00:17,199 --> 00:00:20,800
and their main role in the agile project

10
00:00:19,279 --> 00:00:23,199
is define priorities

11
00:00:20,800 --> 00:00:24,080
and provide input to the project team on

12
00:00:23,199 --> 00:00:26,720
what the team

13
00:00:24,080 --> 00:00:27,279
shows them in demo sessions the scrum

14
00:00:26,720 --> 00:00:30,320
master

15
00:00:27,279 --> 00:00:31,519
is the agile sensei think about him as a

16
00:00:30,320 --> 00:00:33,920
team leader

17
00:00:31,519 --> 00:00:34,960
and that can be a project manager a lead

18
00:00:33,920 --> 00:00:36,880
developer

19
00:00:34,960 --> 00:00:38,640
a person who actually and formerly has a

20
00:00:36,880 --> 00:00:40,640
role of scrum master

21
00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:43,040
or pretty much anyone who wants to play

22
00:00:40,640 --> 00:00:45,280
this role and has agile knowledge

23
00:00:43,040 --> 00:00:47,680
ultimately the main thing is that the

24
00:00:45,280 --> 00:00:49,520
team agrees on who the scrum master is

25
00:00:47,680 --> 00:00:51,840
and of course they can also rotate the

26
00:00:49,520 --> 00:00:53,840
role if they feel like doing it

27
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:55,520
as all of you know i work with agile

28
00:00:53,840 --> 00:00:58,160
projects every day

29
00:00:55,520 --> 00:00:59,600
in sum i'm the scrum master but in the

30
00:00:58,160 --> 00:01:02,000
sum the scrum master

31
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:02,960
is actually a developer in others a

32
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:05,680
tester

33
00:01:02,960 --> 00:01:06,400
and another is even an architect like i

34
00:01:05,680 --> 00:01:08,159
said

35
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:10,000
anyone can play this role as long as

36
00:01:08,159 --> 00:01:12,720
they understand the responsibilities

37
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:14,400
and have sufficient agile knowledge if

38
00:01:12,720 --> 00:01:16,000
someone hasn't even gone through agile

39
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:16,880
training or finished this course at a

40
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,560
minimum

41
00:01:16,880 --> 00:01:20,159
then i wouldn't recommend that person to

42
00:01:18,560 --> 00:01:22,640
play the role of scrum master

43
00:01:20,159 --> 00:01:23,680
since he or she probably wouldn't do it

44
00:01:22,640 --> 00:01:26,640
properly

45
00:01:23,680 --> 00:01:28,320
and finally the delivery team well

46
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:29,759
that's pretty much everyone else so

47
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:32,320
developers testers

48
00:01:29,759 --> 00:01:34,159
business analysts etc the main

49
00:01:32,320 --> 00:01:35,040
responsibility of the delivery team is

50
00:01:34,159 --> 00:01:37,360
quite simple

51
00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:38,479
to deliver they are in charge of getting

52
00:01:37,360 --> 00:01:41,360
the work done

53
00:01:38,479 --> 00:01:42,799
and are key to the team's success now

54
00:01:41,360 --> 00:01:43,680
let's talk about the tools you use in

55
00:01:42,799 --> 00:01:45,119
agile

56
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:47,439
and don't worry if you feel you need

57
00:01:45,119 --> 00:01:49,280
more information i'll add several links

58
00:01:47,439 --> 00:01:51,680
to all of these tools so you can go over

59
00:01:49,280 --> 00:01:53,520
them and read about them in more detail

60
00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:55,040
the first tool i want us to review is

61
00:01:53,520 --> 00:01:58,079
the burn down chart

62
00:01:55,040 --> 00:02:00,640
as its name implies a burn down chart is

63
00:01:58,079 --> 00:02:02,960
a chart that shows the burn down of work

64
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:05,200
so basically you see the number of story

65
00:02:02,960 --> 00:02:08,640
points the team is delivering over time

66
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:11,280
so your team's velocity on the x-axis

67
00:02:08,640 --> 00:02:12,720
you have your sprints and on your y-axis

68
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:14,239
your story points

69
00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:16,640
as you can see in the graph on your

70
00:02:14,239 --> 00:02:19,200
screen you can do this manually

71
00:02:16,640 --> 00:02:20,080
in excel or use tools that automatically

72
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:22,720
do this for you

73
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:24,000
such as jira the great things about the

74
00:02:22,720 --> 00:02:26,160
burn down chart

75
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:28,319
is that in it you can see several things

76
00:02:26,160 --> 00:02:30,480
about your project and your delivery

77
00:02:28,319 --> 00:02:31,360
for example you can see the total amount

78
00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:33,840
of work

79
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:36,959
the amount of work remaining and even

80
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:37,440
your team's velocity the kanban agile

81
00:02:36,959 --> 00:02:39,200
board

82
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:40,480
is probably one of the most exciting

83
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:42,160
things about agile

84
00:02:40,480 --> 00:02:43,760
and i say exciting because of its

85
00:02:42,160 --> 00:02:46,000
simplicity and value

86
00:02:43,760 --> 00:02:47,760
an agile kanban board is a visual

87
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:49,200
representation of the work the team is

88
00:02:47,760 --> 00:02:51,840
doing in a sprint

89
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:53,440
you basically have three or four columns

90
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:55,120
and your user store is displayed in

91
00:02:53,440 --> 00:02:56,560
those columns to reflect the state of

92
00:02:55,120 --> 00:02:58,159
those user stories

93
00:02:56,560 --> 00:02:59,680
generally you would have a column with

94
00:02:58,159 --> 00:03:02,879
the heading to do

95
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:06,159
another one with the heading in progress

96
00:03:02,879 --> 00:03:08,080
another one with the heading in qa and a

97
00:03:06,159 --> 00:03:10,319
final one with done

98
00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:12,159
most agile teams use a physical agile

99
00:03:10,319 --> 00:03:13,760
ken board and sticky notes

100
00:03:12,159 --> 00:03:15,920
as per the picture you see on your

101
00:03:13,760 --> 00:03:18,480
screen but a lot of teams

102
00:03:15,920 --> 00:03:20,080
also use digital boards there is no

103
00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:22,879
right or wrong answer on whether

104
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:24,959
using paper or digital use whatever

105
00:03:22,879 --> 00:03:27,360
works best for you and your team

106
00:03:24,959 --> 00:03:28,560
personally i prefer digital boards and

107
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:32,000
generally use trello

108
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:33,760
or jira but if a team prefers paper

109
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:36,480
i'm happy to do it and have no issues

110
00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:38,319
with using a physical agile kanban board

111
00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:40,000
i'll add links under the resources for

112
00:03:38,319 --> 00:03:40,640
this lecture to the tools i just

113
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:45,440
mentioned

114
00:03:40,640 --> 00:03:45,440
and to the examples of this concept
