1
00:00:01,120 --> 00:00:04,960
now let's go over some key concepts and

2
00:00:03,040 --> 00:00:07,839
terms that are used in agile

3
00:00:04,960 --> 00:00:10,160
let's start with user stories user

4
00:00:07,839 --> 00:00:12,559
stories are basically product features

5
00:00:10,160 --> 00:00:14,160
requirements or tasks that add value to

6
00:00:12,559 --> 00:00:16,320
the end customer

7
00:00:14,160 --> 00:00:18,080
and by adding value i mean that whatever

8
00:00:16,320 --> 00:00:20,160
it is it's something that the end

9
00:00:18,080 --> 00:00:22,320
customer would actually pay for

10
00:00:20,160 --> 00:00:23,439
or they would find really valuable and

11
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:25,119
important

12
00:00:23,439 --> 00:00:27,760
if something doesn't add value to the

13
00:00:25,119 --> 00:00:29,760
customer then it can't be considered a

14
00:00:27,760 --> 00:00:33,120
user story and should remain a task

15
00:00:29,760 --> 00:00:35,120
subtask or requirement user stories are

16
00:00:33,120 --> 00:00:36,640
written a specific format which you can

17
00:00:35,120 --> 00:00:40,000
see on screen

18
00:00:36,640 --> 00:00:41,600
for example as a customer i want to be

19
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,559
able to use my facebook login

20
00:00:41,600 --> 00:00:44,879
credentials

21
00:00:42,559 --> 00:00:46,399
to log into the e-commerce website so

22
00:00:44,879 --> 00:00:47,200
that i don't have to create a new

23
00:00:46,399 --> 00:00:49,600
account

24
00:00:47,200 --> 00:00:50,960
as you can see this user story provides

25
00:00:49,600 --> 00:00:52,800
value to the customer

26
00:00:50,960 --> 00:00:54,399
since it helps him avoid creating a new

27
00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:57,440
user and passwords

28
00:00:54,399 --> 00:01:00,079
hence saving him time so

29
00:00:57,440 --> 00:01:02,000
in agile we create user stories for all

30
00:01:00,079 --> 00:01:04,879
project requirements and features

31
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:06,799
that add value to the customer and then

32
00:01:04,879 --> 00:01:07,760
we add them to what we call the product

33
00:01:06,799 --> 00:01:10,080
backlog

34
00:01:07,760 --> 00:01:11,920
the product backlog basically contains

35
00:01:10,080 --> 00:01:13,040
all the user stories that will be part

36
00:01:11,920 --> 00:01:15,439
of the project

37
00:01:13,040 --> 00:01:16,479
but of course in agile that can be a

38
00:01:15,439 --> 00:01:18,479
changing list

39
00:01:16,479 --> 00:01:20,400
since you must start with say 50 user

40
00:01:18,479 --> 00:01:23,840
stories and over time

41
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:25,600
add 50 more how many you add or remove

42
00:01:23,840 --> 00:01:27,680
will depend on what you and your team

43
00:01:25,600 --> 00:01:29,200
define throughout execution

44
00:01:27,680 --> 00:01:31,439
and you have the flexibility and

45
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:33,759
autonomy to define that

46
00:01:31,439 --> 00:01:35,520
now the sprint backlog is just taking a

47
00:01:33,759 --> 00:01:36,479
couple of user stories from your product

48
00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:38,720
backlog

49
00:01:36,479 --> 00:01:40,320
and adding them to your sprint and

50
00:01:38,720 --> 00:01:42,479
committing to the delivery of those user

51
00:01:40,320 --> 00:01:45,119
stories in that sprint

52
00:01:42,479 --> 00:01:45,600
so basically it's the amount of work you

53
00:01:45,119 --> 00:01:48,159
will do

54
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:50,640
in those two weeks remember that in

55
00:01:48,159 --> 00:01:52,399
agile screens generally last two weeks

56
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:54,399
but you can make them three or four

57
00:01:52,399 --> 00:01:56,399
weeks if you and your team define

58
00:01:54,399 --> 00:01:58,399
that is what is best for you from

59
00:01:56,399 --> 00:02:01,280
experience i recommend two weeks

60
00:01:58,399 --> 00:02:03,520
but like i said that is not mandatory

61
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:05,920
and finally the story points

62
00:02:03,520 --> 00:02:08,399
the story points simply denote the level

63
00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:10,800
of complexity a user story has

64
00:02:08,399 --> 00:02:12,400
so you assign story points to each user

65
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:14,800
story you create

66
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:15,840
personally i'm a big advocate of keeping

67
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:17,680
things simple

68
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:19,440
so generally i would recommend using a

69
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:23,040
basic scale of 1

70
00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:25,680
3 and 5. one being low complexity

71
00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:27,520
three being medium complexity and five

72
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:29,280
being high complexity

73
00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:31,040
now don't worry too much about spending

74
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:31,840
a lot of time estimating your story

75
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:34,319
points

76
00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:36,640
keep it simple follow your instinct

77
00:02:34,319 --> 00:02:38,480
experience and gut feeling

78
00:02:36,640 --> 00:02:41,120
how many story points is something you

79
00:02:38,480 --> 00:02:43,519
can add to each user story as a team

80
00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:44,720
or you can also ask the person working

81
00:02:43,519 --> 00:02:46,959
on the user story

82
00:02:44,720 --> 00:02:48,239
what level of complexity they consider

83
00:02:46,959 --> 00:02:50,239
it has

84
00:02:48,239 --> 00:02:51,680
the scale i have just suggested is just

85
00:02:50,239 --> 00:02:54,080
an example of course

86
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:56,720
you can create your own scale or use

87
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:58,560
existing scales such as fibonacci

88
00:02:56,720 --> 00:03:00,400
discuss with your team what scale they

89
00:02:58,560 --> 00:03:02,319
want to use and use it

90
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:03,519
and if it doesn't work well after you

91
00:03:02,319 --> 00:03:04,080
finish the sprint you'll have the

92
00:03:03,519 --> 00:03:05,680
opportunity

93
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:07,280
to discuss that in your team's

94
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:10,080
retrospective or lessons

95
00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:11,360
learned session and you can then adjust

96
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:13,200
as required

97
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:14,560
if you want to keep it simple then

98
00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:17,840
follow my recommendation of

99
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:19,680
one three and five now let's go over the

100
00:03:17,840 --> 00:03:21,440
concept of velocity

101
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:23,760
do you remember i said that velocity

102
00:03:21,440 --> 00:03:26,000
relates to the speed of execution

103
00:03:23,760 --> 00:03:27,920
well basically the velocity of an agile

104
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:30,560
project is the number of story points

105
00:03:27,920 --> 00:03:33,120
the team delivers over a sprint

106
00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:34,159
i'll repeat that the velocity of an

107
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:36,319
agile project

108
00:03:34,159 --> 00:03:38,159
is the number of story points the team

109
00:03:36,319 --> 00:03:40,159
delivers over a sprint

110
00:03:38,159 --> 00:03:42,319
and of course you will see variations of

111
00:03:40,159 --> 00:03:44,159
that especially at the beginning when

112
00:03:42,319 --> 00:03:45,040
you are just learning how many user

113
00:03:44,159 --> 00:03:47,680
stories you are

114
00:03:45,040 --> 00:03:49,840
actually able to deliver as a team so at

115
00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:51,920
the beginning you are kind of guessing

116
00:03:49,840 --> 00:03:53,840
or estimating how many story points you

117
00:03:51,920 --> 00:03:56,159
can deliver in a sprint

118
00:03:53,840 --> 00:03:58,000
but after a couple of sprints you will

119
00:03:56,159 --> 00:03:58,720
be able to average the number of story

120
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,879
points

121
00:03:58,720 --> 00:04:03,200
and then conclude for example that on

122
00:04:00,879 --> 00:04:06,080
average your team is able to deliver

123
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:07,519
20 story points per sprint and that is

124
00:04:06,080 --> 00:04:09,360
your velocity

125
00:04:07,519 --> 00:04:11,680
you will always be able to calculate

126
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:13,280
your velocity at the end of your sprint

127
00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:15,040
once you have reviewed what you

128
00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:18,320
delivered versus

129
00:04:15,040 --> 00:04:20,000
what you had planned your velocity is

130
00:04:18,320 --> 00:04:21,519
not what you had planned or what you

131
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:23,520
thought you would deliver

132
00:04:21,519 --> 00:04:25,440
it's what you actually delivered in

133
00:04:23,520 --> 00:04:27,759
story points

134
00:04:25,440 --> 00:04:29,280
swim lanes are a visual representation

135
00:04:27,759 --> 00:04:32,000
of the status of stories

136
00:04:29,280 --> 00:04:33,759
on the agile kanban board but that is

137
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:35,840
better understood with an example

138
00:04:33,759 --> 00:04:36,800
and a visual than by me explaining it

139
00:04:35,840 --> 00:04:38,880
with words

140
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:41,120
so don't worry i'll add a link in your

141
00:04:38,880 --> 00:04:43,600
lecture resources so you can check what

142
00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:44,560
swim lanes look like and how you can use

143
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:46,400
them

144
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:47,759
now let's switch to one of my favorite

145
00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:51,600
concepts in agile

146
00:04:47,759 --> 00:04:53,440
the mvp and no this does not stand for

147
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:56,720
most valuable player

148
00:04:53,440 --> 00:05:00,160
in agile mvp stands for minimum

149
00:04:56,720 --> 00:05:02,400
viable product and basically it means

150
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:04,800
the bare minimum you can deliver to meet

151
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:06,560
your customers expectations

152
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:08,000
so if you think about the example we saw

153
00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:11,039
earlier on the course

154
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:14,320
the mvp is the skateboard not

155
00:05:11,039 --> 00:05:15,919
the ferrari and this is really powerful

156
00:05:14,320 --> 00:05:17,919
because this will allow you to deliver

157
00:05:15,919 --> 00:05:20,160
quickly and often

158
00:05:17,919 --> 00:05:20,960
and iterate and build up and enhance

159
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:25,440
your solution

160
00:05:20,960 --> 00:05:27,440
over time this is a key agile principle

161
00:05:25,440 --> 00:05:29,600
a release as the name implies is when

162
00:05:27,440 --> 00:05:31,440
you move your user stories to a

163
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:34,320
production environment

164
00:05:31,440 --> 00:05:36,320
so when you make them live generally

165
00:05:34,320 --> 00:05:37,360
agile teams make releases to production

166
00:05:36,320 --> 00:05:40,080
once a month

167
00:05:37,360 --> 00:05:41,120
so after two sprints but you might find

168
00:05:40,080 --> 00:05:43,440
some agile team

169
00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:44,880
making releases to production every four

170
00:05:43,440 --> 00:05:47,520
sprints and not two

171
00:05:44,880 --> 00:05:47,919
so every two months at the end of the

172
00:05:47,520 --> 00:05:50,080
day

173
00:05:47,919 --> 00:05:51,440
that is for the project team to decide

174
00:05:50,080 --> 00:05:53,360
but remember

175
00:05:51,440 --> 00:05:56,240
agile is about doing things quickly and

176
00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:58,639
efficiently so the shorter the better

177
00:05:56,240 --> 00:06:00,240
but don't push it too much be careful

178
00:05:58,639 --> 00:06:02,240
with exaggerating

179
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:04,479
try to keep a good balance and releases

180
00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:07,680
that keep the team comfortable

181
00:06:04,479 --> 00:06:09,199
and finally the sprint by now you're

182
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:10,000
already familiar with what a sprint

183
00:06:09,199 --> 00:06:12,960
means

184
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:13,840
but let's recap anyway a sprint is a

185
00:06:12,960 --> 00:06:15,680
period of time

186
00:06:13,840 --> 00:06:17,280
over which the team will deliver a set

187
00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:20,319
of user stories

188
00:06:17,280 --> 00:06:21,360
generally sprints last two weeks but

189
00:06:20,319 --> 00:06:23,360
some teams

190
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:24,479
may have their sprints set up for three

191
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:27,199
or four weeks

192
00:06:24,479 --> 00:06:28,479
and that's okay you need to define what

193
00:06:27,199 --> 00:06:30,560
works best for you

194
00:06:28,479 --> 00:06:33,039
and your team given your specific

195
00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:35,600
context and project dynamics

196
00:06:33,039 --> 00:06:37,600
but if you're unsure start with two

197
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:39,520
weeks and then change that to three or

198
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:42,479
four if required

199
00:06:39,520 --> 00:06:43,199
remember in agile you're allowed to

200
00:06:42,479 --> 00:06:45,919
experiment

201
00:06:43,199 --> 00:06:47,680
so that you can review adapt and adjust

202
00:06:45,919 --> 00:06:51,599
to whatever works best for you

203
00:06:47,680 --> 00:06:51,599
and your team
