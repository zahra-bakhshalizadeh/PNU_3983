1
00:00:00,599 --> 00:00:07,029
Pat, the PM and Bailey, the BA are working
on their CRM project, and they know that stakeholder

2
00:00:07,029 --> 00:00:11,190
management will be a big factor in their success.

3
00:00:11,190 --> 00:00:16,289
They're especially concerned about the project
due to the stakeholder being extremely busy

4
00:00:16,289 --> 00:00:22,410
and not having time for the project, yet this
project is looking to change a lot about what

5
00:00:22,410 --> 00:00:25,289
these stakeholder groups do.

6
00:00:25,289 --> 00:00:32,189
Our stakeholders have full time jobs, and
the project is usually a side job for them.

7
00:00:32,189 --> 00:00:38,030
Imagine having your full time job and in addition,
getting several meeting requests per day from

8
00:00:38,030 --> 00:00:40,219
a project team.

9
00:00:40,219 --> 00:00:45,780
These other meetings take a lower priority
and can easily add stress to your day, right?

10
00:00:45,780 --> 00:00:52,800
Well, for each stakeholder, the project is
one entity, so it can look overwhelming to

11
00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:58,889
get so many meeting invites from the team,
it can look like the project team isn't coordinated

12
00:00:58,889 --> 00:01:01,870
using their time well.

13
00:01:01,870 --> 00:01:08,140
Managing stakeholders is a shared responsibility
between the PM and the BA on the project.

14
00:01:08,140 --> 00:01:15,430
So what does successful PM and BA collaboration
look like in the area of stakeholder management?

15
00:01:15,430 --> 00:01:20,430
It means regular touch bases to discuss which
stakeholders you're meeting with and what

16
00:01:20,430 --> 00:01:22,460
the agenda is with them.

17
00:01:22,460 --> 00:01:28,240
At times this entails combining meetings when
both are meeting with the same person in the

18
00:01:28,240 --> 00:01:30,619
same time frame.

19
00:01:30,619 --> 00:01:35,430
Collaborating together on these meetings involves
working together to empathize with wherever

20
00:01:35,430 --> 00:01:42,890
stakeholders at and creating shared key messages
when meeting with them.What does this create?

21
00:01:42,890 --> 00:01:48,259
It creates a shared front in the eyes of a
stakeholder who may need to see this partnership

22
00:01:48,259 --> 00:01:53,299
to trust what you're doing and feel comfortable
contributing some tactical things.

23
00:01:53,299 --> 00:01:58,170
Pat and Bailey discussed about stakeholders
together are things like the role of each

24
00:01:58,170 --> 00:02:01,399
stakeholder and expectations.

25
00:02:01,399 --> 00:02:07,990
Who influences the stakeholder and who do
they influence and what's going on in their

26
00:02:07,990 --> 00:02:13,720
area that may connect with the project or
project stress.

27
00:02:13,720 --> 00:02:18,140
What is the stakeholders current mindset about
the project and the time they're investing

28
00:02:18,140 --> 00:02:20,600
with the team?

29
00:02:20,600 --> 00:02:24,830
Pat and Bailey have found that all of this
helps build better relationships, trust and

30
00:02:24,830 --> 00:02:25,830
engagement.

31
00:02:25,830 --> 00:02:31,440
It also helped them bring stakeholders in
as stakeholders could now see the value of

32
00:02:31,440 --> 00:02:37,650
their time and how it would be used, pat and
Bailey stakeholder before struggled to see

33
00:02:37,650 --> 00:02:43,090
how their time with the project team would
be useful to their full time jobs.

34
00:02:43,090 --> 00:02:48,100
Now they see how working with the team helps
them in other areas as well.

35
00:02:48,100 --> 00:02:53,250
And Pat and Bailey are also very sensitive
to ensure the time is used well to maximize

36
00:02:53,250 --> 00:02:59,730
this Pat and Bailey do this by helping their
stakeholders see and imagine the future, which

37
00:02:59,730 --> 00:03:01,700
impacts everything they work on.
