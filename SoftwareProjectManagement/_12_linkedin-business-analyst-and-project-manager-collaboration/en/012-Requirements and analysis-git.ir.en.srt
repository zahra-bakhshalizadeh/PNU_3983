1
00:00:01,449 --> 00:00:02,909
Requirements and analysis.

2
00:00:02,909 --> 00:00:05,700
This is all on the BA. right.

3
00:00:05,700 --> 00:00:12,179
Well while Bailey does own the requirements
process Pat the PM needs to be informed and

4
00:00:12,179 --> 00:00:14,400
consulted on the plan.

5
00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:20,190
The progress stakeholder interactions and
both need a collaborative understanding of

6
00:00:20,190 --> 00:00:23,750
what the highest value requirements are.

7
00:00:23,750 --> 00:00:30,020
Much of this is driven by prioritization knowing
which requirements are of the highest priority

8
00:00:30,020 --> 00:00:34,370
brings Pat and Bailey's collaboration into
focus.

9
00:00:34,370 --> 00:00:40,430
Pat is managing vendors planning resources
and facilitating the work activities of the

10
00:00:40,430 --> 00:00:41,430
team.

11
00:00:41,430 --> 00:00:46,890
If the highest priority requirements are not
clear the team is likely spending time on

12
00:00:46,890 --> 00:00:52,829
things that may not matter during the requirements
and analysis activities.

13
00:00:52,829 --> 00:00:59,320
It's important to bring Pat up to speed and
into the activities the important times Bailey

14
00:00:59,320 --> 00:01:06,229
brings Pat in are the plan for requirements
and when it's changing and when new stakeholders

15
00:01:06,229 --> 00:01:07,909
are needed.

16
00:01:07,909 --> 00:01:15,590
Also when the analysis shows complexities
and risks to delivering the intended value

17
00:01:15,590 --> 00:01:21,130
it's also important for Pat to understand
and weigh in on what will be documented for

18
00:01:21,130 --> 00:01:22,200
requirements.

19
00:01:22,200 --> 00:01:28,360
Some projects and teams use little documentation
due to a small work in progress and a small

20
00:01:28,360 --> 00:01:29,679
team.

21
00:01:29,679 --> 00:01:35,319
Other Teams require large amounts of documentation
and requirements due to various factors in

22
00:01:35,319 --> 00:01:38,999
how the project is set up.

23
00:01:38,999 --> 00:01:44,149
Bailey is as transparent as possible on the
status of the requirements activities as they

24
00:01:44,149 --> 00:01:47,459
progress to keep patent formed.

25
00:01:47,459 --> 00:01:52,869
They have learned through the years working
together to report status on activities and

26
00:01:52,869 --> 00:02:00,130
towards completion of the milestones not completion
of a document Bailey has also learned to be

27
00:02:00,130 --> 00:02:06,319
transparent about what requirements activities
are and has found this to be a critical thing

28
00:02:06,319 --> 00:02:12,160
in building a trusting relationship with Pat
another area.

29
00:02:12,160 --> 00:02:17,520
During the requirements and analysis activities
Pat and Bailey collaborate on is the approval

30
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:20,670
of requirements for some teams.

31
00:02:20,670 --> 00:02:26,610
This happens with a decision maker and a verbal
approval and for other teams there is a lengthy

32
00:02:26,610 --> 00:02:32,670
signoff process with multiple parties signing
off and formal approval processes.

33
00:02:32,670 --> 00:02:38,319
Either way it's important for Pat and Bailey
to have a shared understanding of the process

34
00:02:38,319 --> 00:02:43,519
and progress when analyzing requirements.

35
00:02:43,519 --> 00:02:50,170
Bailey communicates to Pat what the highest
value requirements are this continues dialogue

36
00:02:50,170 --> 00:02:57,709
between Pat and Bailey which ensures the right
focus areas are in view for both roles.

37
00:02:57,709 --> 00:03:03,010
And when working on collaborating on requirements
it helps hugely when requirements are phrased

38
00:03:03,010 --> 00:03:09,819
in business terminology and phrased in increments
of value they should be understandable from

39
00:03:09,819 --> 00:03:16,590
a customer point of view and easy to understand
for the project manager and business leader.

40
00:03:16,590 --> 00:03:24,260
This allows Pat Bailey and the business leaders
to discuss key requirements and decisions

41
00:03:24,260 --> 00:03:31,400
requirements analysis is so important to projects
and bringing the PM into it at the appropriate

42
00:03:31,400 --> 00:03:32,540
places.

43
00:03:32,540 --> 00:03:33,459
Makes it even better.
