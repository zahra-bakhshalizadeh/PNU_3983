1
00:00:00,719 --> 00:00:03,360
pat the pm is worried about the project

2
00:00:02,800 --> 00:00:06,000
deadline

3
00:00:03,360 --> 00:00:07,359
it's coming up quick and bailey is

4
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:09,840
concerned about the quality

5
00:00:07,359 --> 00:00:10,960
requirements were rushed scope was added

6
00:00:09,840 --> 00:00:13,120
along the way

7
00:00:10,960 --> 00:00:14,960
and testing is showing lots of issues

8
00:00:13,120 --> 00:00:18,080
that will impact the business teams and

9
00:00:14,960 --> 00:00:21,199
customers if the team implements

10
00:00:18,080 --> 00:00:23,279
try to take a rubber band and stretch it

11
00:00:21,199 --> 00:00:25,279
three ways into a triangle

12
00:00:23,279 --> 00:00:27,039
now if we pull one of the corners out

13
00:00:25,279 --> 00:00:29,199
putting pressure on that corner what

14
00:00:27,039 --> 00:00:31,279
happens to these other corners

15
00:00:29,199 --> 00:00:32,399
they get stressed out and they might

16
00:00:31,279 --> 00:00:34,079
break

17
00:00:32,399 --> 00:00:36,160
the triple constraint of project

18
00:00:34,079 --> 00:00:38,719
management works the same

19
00:00:36,160 --> 00:00:41,040
cost schedule and scope is what the

20
00:00:38,719 --> 00:00:43,600
triple constraint is made of

21
00:00:41,040 --> 00:00:44,320
how this works is that if you increase

22
00:00:43,600 --> 00:00:47,039
the need

23
00:00:44,320 --> 00:00:47,520
or importance of one the others get

24
00:00:47,039 --> 00:00:50,640
stressed

25
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:53,520
and need attention too so if we

26
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:55,520
increase the scope the cost and schedule

27
00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:58,320
need to increase as well

28
00:00:55,520 --> 00:00:59,760
makes sense right isn't it funny how

29
00:00:58,320 --> 00:01:02,719
easy it is to say

30
00:00:59,760 --> 00:01:05,040
yes to increasing one without planning

31
00:01:02,719 --> 00:01:08,400
for the increase in the others

32
00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:10,320
as easy as it is and as much as it seems

33
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:13,280
our leaders expect magic

34
00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:15,280
it's detrimental to project success to

35
00:01:13,280 --> 00:01:18,000
allow a pattern of thinking that one

36
00:01:15,280 --> 00:01:20,560
doesn't impact the others

37
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:21,040
pat and bailey are in the heat of this

38
00:01:20,560 --> 00:01:23,360
pat

39
00:01:21,040 --> 00:01:25,600
concerned about missing the deadline and

40
00:01:23,360 --> 00:01:29,280
bailey concerned about the quality due

41
00:01:25,600 --> 00:01:31,520
to rushed requirements and added scope

42
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:33,600
project managers and bas collaborate

43
00:01:31,520 --> 00:01:35,680
together with leaders to understand

44
00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:37,680
which of the three triple constraint

45
00:01:35,680 --> 00:01:39,600
areas are the most important

46
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:41,119
to meeting objectives and delivering

47
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:43,920
value

48
00:01:41,119 --> 00:01:44,560
the pm and ba need to be in sync

49
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:47,360
together

50
00:01:44,560 --> 00:01:49,439
with both the leaders and the team in

51
00:01:47,360 --> 00:01:51,600
understanding which of the three will

52
00:01:49,439 --> 00:01:54,560
lead decision making

53
00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:55,840
this decision can impact strategy and

54
00:01:54,560 --> 00:01:59,040
how well the project

55
00:01:55,840 --> 00:02:00,640
executes on a leader's strategy so for

56
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:03,280
example

57
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:04,640
on a project implementing a new customer

58
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:07,439
billing system

59
00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:08,479
an organization that leads with cost as

60
00:02:07,439 --> 00:02:11,440
the driver

61
00:02:08,479 --> 00:02:14,239
will sacrifice schedule and scope to

62
00:02:11,440 --> 00:02:17,760
some degree to hit the cost objectives

63
00:02:14,239 --> 00:02:20,080
and likewise if scope is prioritized

64
00:02:17,760 --> 00:02:21,520
schedule and costs will not be optimized

65
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:23,920
as much

66
00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:25,840
so which to prioritize depends on the

67
00:02:23,920 --> 00:02:28,080
real business objectives

68
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:29,760
and in a perfect world all three are

69
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:32,080
balanced

70
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:34,239
let's say the customer experience is the

71
00:02:32,080 --> 00:02:36,160
most important factor in making the

72
00:02:34,239 --> 00:02:38,080
project successful

73
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:39,519
and if the customer experience with the

74
00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:41,519
new billing system

75
00:02:39,519 --> 00:02:43,680
isn't at a certain level the project

76
00:02:41,519 --> 00:02:46,560
isn't even worth doing

77
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:48,560
then scope and quality need to lead over

78
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:51,440
cost and schedule

79
00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:52,560
if we demand if at certain scope quality

80
00:02:51,440 --> 00:02:55,440
cost and schedule

81
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:57,280
all be important then the team needs to

82
00:02:55,440 --> 00:03:00,560
understand minimums in each

83
00:02:57,280 --> 00:03:01,840
area and if it's feasible what's

84
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:04,319
interesting to me

85
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:06,800
is that many teams think that cost and

86
00:03:04,319 --> 00:03:09,680
schedule lead their projects

87
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:10,800
yet when i ask the leaders what they

88
00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:12,959
think

89
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:14,720
they answer scope and quality and

90
00:03:12,959 --> 00:03:16,640
customer experience

91
00:03:14,720 --> 00:03:19,440
meaning they want the right thing to be

92
00:03:16,640 --> 00:03:22,159
built at the right quality level

93
00:03:19,440 --> 00:03:24,319
so it's important for pms and bas to

94
00:03:22,159 --> 00:03:26,319
collaborate together with leaders

95
00:03:24,319 --> 00:03:29,040
to get at the true drivers and

96
00:03:26,319 --> 00:03:31,200
motivations of the project

97
00:03:29,040 --> 00:03:32,720
keep success in plain view with the

98
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:35,040
triple constraint

99
00:03:32,720 --> 00:03:36,879
by talking through which is leading and

100
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:40,239
how the project will manage

101
00:03:36,879 --> 00:03:42,000
when the wrong one pulls the others

102
00:03:40,239 --> 00:03:44,560
managing the triple constraint is a

103
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:51,840
great way for pms and bas to

104
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:51,840
anchor key collaboration points
