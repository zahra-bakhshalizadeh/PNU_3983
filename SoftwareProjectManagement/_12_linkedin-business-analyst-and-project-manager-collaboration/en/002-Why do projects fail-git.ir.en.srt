1
00:00:00,640 --> 00:00:03,919
we can all cite why projects we've been

2
00:00:02,800 --> 00:00:06,240
on have failed

3
00:00:03,919 --> 00:00:07,440
and research studies give us many clues

4
00:00:06,240 --> 00:00:09,440
as well

5
00:00:07,440 --> 00:00:10,960
but have you ever really looked at how

6
00:00:09,440 --> 00:00:12,960
the pm and ba

7
00:00:10,960 --> 00:00:15,920
relationship could contribute to these

8
00:00:12,960 --> 00:00:18,160
failures and possibly even prevent them

9
00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:20,960
let's look at a few ideas

10
00:00:18,160 --> 00:00:22,000
first lack of stakeholder engagement and

11
00:00:20,960 --> 00:00:25,119
involvement

12
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:27,199
and this includes engaged sponsors

13
00:00:25,119 --> 00:00:29,039
and sponsors having clear vision and

14
00:00:27,199 --> 00:00:32,000
objectives

15
00:00:29,039 --> 00:00:32,960
the ba and pm have key roles in helping

16
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:35,760
the leaders

17
00:00:32,960 --> 00:00:36,320
take the vision and objectives and turn

18
00:00:35,760 --> 00:00:39,440
them from

19
00:00:36,320 --> 00:00:40,800
strategy to execution stakeholder

20
00:00:39,440 --> 00:00:43,360
involvement at the leader

21
00:00:40,800 --> 00:00:44,239
and contributor levels is key to making

22
00:00:43,360 --> 00:00:47,600
the strategy

23
00:00:44,239 --> 00:00:49,760
and vision a reality the pm

24
00:00:47,600 --> 00:00:51,680
and ba are the team members that

25
00:00:49,760 --> 00:00:52,399
interact with stakeholders and leaders

26
00:00:51,680 --> 00:00:55,520
the most

27
00:00:52,399 --> 00:00:56,960
throughout the project when both roles

28
00:00:55,520 --> 00:00:58,239
are interacting with the same

29
00:00:56,960 --> 00:01:00,800
stakeholders and

30
00:00:58,239 --> 00:01:02,719
often there's a need to collaborate

31
00:01:00,800 --> 00:01:05,680
tightly on these interactions

32
00:01:02,719 --> 00:01:07,360
to keep stakeholder engagement high

33
00:01:05,680 --> 00:01:10,080
these stakeholders typically have

34
00:01:07,360 --> 00:01:12,560
full-time roles outside of the project

35
00:01:10,080 --> 00:01:13,520
so keeping the engagement strong yet not

36
00:01:12,560 --> 00:01:16,240
burdemsome

37
00:01:13,520 --> 00:01:18,799
is a key element next changing

38
00:01:16,240 --> 00:01:21,520
priorities is a key failure point

39
00:01:18,799 --> 00:01:22,400
how teams handle changing priorities can

40
00:01:21,520 --> 00:01:24,840
have a huge

41
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:26,080
impact on if value gets delivered on

42
00:01:24,840 --> 00:01:28,400
projects

43
00:01:26,080 --> 00:01:30,479
this value point also points back to

44
00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:33,759
stakeholder involvement

45
00:01:30,479 --> 00:01:36,320
the pm and ba are both heavily involved

46
00:01:33,759 --> 00:01:38,840
in managing priorities with stakeholders

47
00:01:36,320 --> 00:01:40,159
and influencing stakeholders on

48
00:01:38,840 --> 00:01:43,200
prioritization

49
00:01:40,159 --> 00:01:45,040
and last changing requirements

50
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:47,439
changing requirements can be a good

51
00:01:45,040 --> 00:01:50,240
thing or a bad thing

52
00:01:47,439 --> 00:01:52,159
embracing changing requirements can lead

53
00:01:50,240 --> 00:01:53,040
to a competitive advantage if the

54
00:01:52,159 --> 00:01:55,280
changes

55
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:57,840
are result of learning more about what

56
00:01:55,280 --> 00:02:00,560
customers and users needs are

57
00:01:57,840 --> 00:02:02,399
at the same time if the project can't

58
00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:04,719
seem to deliver anything

59
00:02:02,399 --> 00:02:05,600
due to starts and stops with constant

60
00:02:04,719 --> 00:02:08,800
changes

61
00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:11,360
this can lead to failure the pm

62
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:13,360
and ba collaborate heavily on helping

63
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:15,920
stakeholders and the team

64
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:17,599
identify and manage requirements into

65
00:02:15,920 --> 00:02:20,560
pieces of work

66
00:02:17,599 --> 00:02:22,400
these deliverables if not well defined

67
00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:24,480
can be delivered in increments that make

68
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:25,920
requirements change less risky

69
00:02:24,480 --> 00:02:28,000
while leveraging change for a

70
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:30,879
competitive advantage

71
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:31,599
pat the pm and bayley the ba start

72
00:02:30,879 --> 00:02:34,239
getting into

73
00:02:31,599 --> 00:02:36,400
deep discussions on what does success

74
00:02:34,239 --> 00:02:38,640
mean on a project anyway

75
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:39,760
is it when a project is delivered on

76
00:02:38,640 --> 00:02:42,800
schedule

77
00:02:39,760 --> 00:02:43,760
within budget results in a working

78
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:46,319
product

79
00:02:43,760 --> 00:02:48,080
or meets the business intent they

80
00:02:46,319 --> 00:02:50,000
determine that the best approach for

81
00:02:48,080 --> 00:02:52,959
them is to collaborate on defining

82
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:54,959
success for projects with stakeholders

83
00:02:52,959 --> 00:02:57,280
the business intent may be to beat a

84
00:02:54,959 --> 00:03:00,400
competitor to market while sacrificing

85
00:02:57,280 --> 00:03:02,080
quality and cost time is most important

86
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:05,040
to success

87
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:07,120
or the product working at a determined

88
00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:09,120
quality level with customer delight

89
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:10,800
may be far more important than cost and

90
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:12,959
schedule

91
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:15,440
most leaders want cost schedule and

92
00:03:12,959 --> 00:03:17,280
quality while delighting the customer

93
00:03:15,440 --> 00:03:20,000
but it's important to know which is

94
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:21,920
leading the success equation

95
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:24,080
pat and bailey have found that this has

96
00:03:21,920 --> 00:03:31,840
dramatically changed how they work

97
00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:31,840
and collaborate
