1
00:00:00,750 --> 00:00:04,270
project managers and business analysts are
like a dynamic duo.

2
00:00:04,270 --> 00:00:11,240
A great relationship between the pm and ba
makes for promising project results.

3
00:00:11,240 --> 00:00:14,090
But there's confusing overlap at times.

4
00:00:14,090 --> 00:00:22,910
So what are the areas where these roles overlap
the most scoping and planning, communications,

5
00:00:22,910 --> 00:00:26,910
stakeholder relationships and management,
and risk management?

6
00:00:26,910 --> 00:00:28,930
Let's look at each area.

7
00:00:28,930 --> 00:00:31,730
First scoping and planning.

8
00:00:31,730 --> 00:00:36,750
Many PMS do some of this before a BA is assigned
on the project.

9
00:00:36,750 --> 00:00:42,190
And since the BAs focus is the product in
defining what the product is in varying levels

10
00:00:42,190 --> 00:00:49,140
of detail, it's imperative that the BA either
do the scoping, or clarify the scope of the

11
00:00:49,140 --> 00:00:53,540
product from a functional and user point of
view.

12
00:00:53,540 --> 00:00:59,120
Scope clarification leads to better planning
for the whole project team which results in

13
00:00:59,120 --> 00:01:05,379
better detail requirements, better estimates
and involving the right stakeholders.

14
00:01:05,379 --> 00:01:07,380
And this benefits everyone.

15
00:01:07,380 --> 00:01:09,930
Next communications.

16
00:01:09,930 --> 00:01:15,460
many team members and stakeholders get communications
from so many on the team.

17
00:01:15,460 --> 00:01:19,140
And the pm and ba may be the most common offenders.

18
00:01:19,140 --> 00:01:26,000
No really, communications are good, but great
communications are coordinated, collaborated

19
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:27,580
and make sense to the audience.

20
00:01:27,580 --> 00:01:35,200
PMs and BAs work together to strategize key
messages for various team members and stakeholders

21
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:42,640
and work to communicate a consistent message
that uses the team and stakeholders time effectively.

22
00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:45,680
Next to stakeholder relationships and management.

23
00:01:45,680 --> 00:01:53,530
Together, PMs and BAs can create trusting
and engaging relationships with project stakeholders

24
00:01:53,530 --> 00:01:59,979
when not collaborating on the relationships
often trust issues build and engagement drops

25
00:01:59,979 --> 00:02:03,200
Creating a high risk for project failure.

26
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:05,850
And last is risk management.

27
00:02:05,850 --> 00:02:12,000
Risk can come from many areas, and the pm
and ba typically have many of them covered.

28
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:17,950
What's important is that PMs and BAs work
together to discuss the risks and work through

29
00:02:17,950 --> 00:02:21,129
the mitigation and response plans together.

30
00:02:21,129 --> 00:02:27,330
BAs need to pay careful attention to the risks
to the user, and the customer experience and

31
00:02:27,330 --> 00:02:32,930
processes, scope, stakeholders communication
and risk.

32
00:02:32,930 --> 00:02:35,019
These are the key areas of overlap.

33
00:02:35,019 --> 00:02:40,730
If you're thinking, wow, this means I spend
a lot of time with the pm or ba.

34
00:02:40,730 --> 00:02:42,330
You're right on.

35
00:02:42,330 --> 00:02:48,930
Yes, collaboration between these roles is
intense and all for good reason.
