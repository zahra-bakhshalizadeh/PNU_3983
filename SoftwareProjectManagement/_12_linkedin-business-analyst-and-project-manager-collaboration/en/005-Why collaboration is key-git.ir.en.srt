1
00:00:00,650 --> 00:00:05,950
Pat the PM and Bailey, the BA are about to
start a new project together.

2
00:00:05,950 --> 00:00:09,700
They're working together to plan out key aspects
of the project.

3
00:00:09,700 --> 00:00:11,440
And they have a sensitive stakeholder.

4
00:00:11,440 --> 00:00:13,780
For a moment.

5
00:00:13,780 --> 00:00:17,600
Let's imagine that we're that stakeholder,
Jennifer.

6
00:00:17,600 --> 00:00:23,670
as Jennifer, you're a full time manager of
a payroll department, Your days are filled

7
00:00:23,670 --> 00:00:29,539
managing a large staff vendors, technology
and payroll cycles.

8
00:00:29,539 --> 00:00:36,230
You're dealing with expectations, regulatory
changes, taxation, operational quotas and

9
00:00:36,230 --> 00:00:37,680
deadlines.

10
00:00:37,680 --> 00:00:45,350
And your customers or employees to get payroll,
just want to be paid on time and paid correctly.

11
00:00:45,350 --> 00:00:49,700
You're put on a new project that's looking
to improve the systems that make all this

12
00:00:49,700 --> 00:00:51,460
payroll happen.

13
00:00:51,460 --> 00:00:57,871
Suddenly, in addition to your normal and stressful
responsibilities as a payroll manager, you

14
00:00:57,871 --> 00:01:00,100
get meeting invites from three or four

15
00:01:00,100 --> 00:01:04,930
Different people on the project team, you
don't really know who they all are or their

16
00:01:04,930 --> 00:01:10,610
roles, and the demands, emails and meetings
just keep coming.

17
00:01:10,610 --> 00:01:16,080
You simply don't have time for all this nervous
space in your brain to keep any of it straight.

18
00:01:16,080 --> 00:01:18,480
You've got a department to run.

19
00:01:18,480 --> 00:01:21,760
Now, let's imagine it differently.

20
00:01:21,760 --> 00:01:24,500
Instead, for the project.

21
00:01:24,500 --> 00:01:26,630
you first meet Pat and Bailey.

22
00:01:26,630 --> 00:01:31,700
They explain their roles as the pm and ba
how they work together.

23
00:01:31,700 --> 00:01:37,720
And with you, they determine a schedule of
meetings and expectations that works for you.

24
00:01:37,720 --> 00:01:43,140
You now know why it's important to go to certain
meetings and discuss with them what you actually

25
00:01:43,140 --> 00:01:44,740
have time for.

26
00:01:44,740 --> 00:01:51,260
Communications, emails, and meetings are coordinated
so that it makes sense to you in the team

27
00:01:51,260 --> 00:01:55,000
and it's organized from your perspective.

28
00:01:55,000 --> 00:02:01,290
This type of collaboration Pat and Bailey
demonstrate is not by accident.

29
00:02:01,290 --> 00:02:08,599
When a pm and ba work together and managing
stakeholders, communications, risk and scope,

30
00:02:08,599 --> 00:02:14,700
it builds trust, reduces risk and engages
stakeholders.

31
00:02:14,700 --> 00:02:20,400
This leads to better quality products and
great relationships that ultimately leads

32
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:23,659
to getting the project done on time within
budget.

33
00:02:23,659 --> 00:02:28,499
And while meeting the needs of stakeholders
and delivering value.

34
00:02:28,499 --> 00:02:31,629
Many things go into successful projects.

35
00:02:31,629 --> 00:02:35,590
And there is no doubt that collaboration is
at the top of the list.
