1
00:00:00,550 --> 00:00:05,830
So what does the ideal partnership for a project
manager and BA look like?

2
00:00:05,830 --> 00:00:11,680
Well, I've been on a lot of projects as a
BA with great PM relationships.

3
00:00:11,680 --> 00:00:13,440
And here's what it looked and felt like.

4
00:00:13,440 --> 00:00:18,619
I typically touch base with the PM first thing
in the morning to see what's on her mind as

5
00:00:18,619 --> 00:00:20,930
priorities for the day.

6
00:00:20,930 --> 00:00:25,419
We discussed the meetings we have scheduled,
who the stakeholders are in those meetings

7
00:00:25,419 --> 00:00:30,689
and the meeting goals, and we make decisions
on adjusting any meetings to make the stakeholder

8
00:00:30,689 --> 00:00:33,390
interactions positive.

9
00:00:33,390 --> 00:00:38,480
We also discussed the previous day's stakeholder
interactions and other updates from the last

10
00:00:38,480 --> 00:00:40,109
day or so.

11
00:00:40,109 --> 00:00:44,829
Throughout the day, we run into each other
a few times and see how we can support one

12
00:00:44,829 --> 00:00:51,940
another with key messages to others and being
consistent in our actions and priorities.

13
00:00:51,940 --> 00:00:57,170
It's also quite common for me as the BA to
have dialogue with stakeholders that could

14
00:00:57,170 --> 00:01:03,600
introduce scope creep, scope, creep. is when
items get added to the scope without the right

15
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:08,930
governance around making sure that it's truly
the right scope to add.

16
00:01:08,930 --> 00:01:14,080
It can easily happen in requirements discussions,
and it's something I like to talk to the PM

17
00:01:14,080 --> 00:01:16,240
about as soon as I can.

18
00:01:16,240 --> 00:01:22,640
I want to give her a heads up on that dialogue,
while I investigate the value, risk and impact

19
00:01:22,640 --> 00:01:26,220
of any changes as well as the feasibility.

20
00:01:26,220 --> 00:01:30,210
The PM can also help with discovering these
critical things.

21
00:01:30,210 --> 00:01:34,460
And together, we can make sure the right decisions
are made.

22
00:01:34,460 --> 00:01:39,820
I often grab coffee or lunch with a PM for
more casual dialogue, and time to reflect

23
00:01:39,820 --> 00:01:43,420
on risks and stakeholder relationships.

24
00:01:43,420 --> 00:01:48,930
This is where some really good insights come
in, as well as a deeper relationship between

25
00:01:48,930 --> 00:01:51,030
the PM and myself.

26
00:01:51,030 --> 00:01:56,860
I want her to know that I'm thinking about
things like how I'm approaching my work and

27
00:01:56,860 --> 00:01:59,390
caring for the project as a whole.

28
00:01:59,390 --> 00:02:03,130
I want to build Trust and transparency with
the PM.

29
00:02:03,130 --> 00:02:09,020
So we can focus on leading and influencing
together as a team.

30
00:02:09,020 --> 00:02:13,340
Think about how this might be different from
your PM BA relationship.

31
00:02:13,340 --> 00:02:17,020
What can you do to improve your partnership?

32
00:02:17,020 --> 00:02:23,470
The partnership between the PM and BA is one
that can literally be magical for the project.

33
00:02:23,470 --> 00:02:28,250
A great partnership can build trust in the
team and stakeholders.

34
00:02:28,250 --> 00:02:34,340
And my favorite part is that it's rewarding
and feels good to have a great partnership

35
00:02:34,340 --> 00:02:35,200
on the job.
