1
00:00:00,640 --> 00:00:07,759
so how do pat the pm and bailey the ba

2
00:00:04,240 --> 00:00:10,160
work together to plan and estimate

3
00:00:07,759 --> 00:00:11,360
the ba is responsible for defining the

4
00:00:10,160 --> 00:00:14,400
product

5
00:00:11,360 --> 00:00:18,000
and the pm defines the project

6
00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:20,320
the project delivers the product

7
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:21,039
how could anyone plan a project without

8
00:00:20,320 --> 00:00:23,680
a great

9
00:00:21,039 --> 00:00:25,599
understanding of the product well

10
00:00:23,680 --> 00:00:27,840
depending how much the product has been

11
00:00:25,599 --> 00:00:30,960
defined when the planning happens

12
00:00:27,840 --> 00:00:33,360
planning can be impacted dramatically

13
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:35,040
in some ways i've always thought it was

14
00:00:33,360 --> 00:00:35,840
silly to estimate and plan for

15
00:00:35,040 --> 00:00:38,559
requirements

16
00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:40,960
when the requirements are not yet known

17
00:00:38,559 --> 00:00:43,280
at the same time with experience

18
00:00:40,960 --> 00:00:44,000
we learned to work with ambiguity by

19
00:00:43,280 --> 00:00:47,280
working in

20
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:48,719
layers and we also learned to plan to

21
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:51,920
replan as we learn

22
00:00:48,719 --> 00:00:55,199
more and bailey and pat plan to replan

23
00:00:51,920 --> 00:00:56,559
as they go to they realize that planning

24
00:00:55,199 --> 00:00:58,719
with ambiguity

25
00:00:56,559 --> 00:00:59,760
helps leaders make decisions and

26
00:00:58,719 --> 00:01:03,280
re-planning

27
00:00:59,760 --> 00:01:04,879
is expected so what is there to be

28
00:01:03,280 --> 00:01:07,119
planned and estimated

29
00:01:04,879 --> 00:01:08,880
and how do patent bailey collaborate on

30
00:01:07,119 --> 00:01:11,520
this

31
00:01:08,880 --> 00:01:12,080
first bailly and pat plan what the

32
00:01:11,520 --> 00:01:14,159
actual

33
00:01:12,080 --> 00:01:15,600
product is and understanding what

34
00:01:14,159 --> 00:01:18,479
outcomes are expected

35
00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:20,720
and for whom for some projects these are

36
00:01:18,479 --> 00:01:24,000
backlog items releases

37
00:01:20,720 --> 00:01:26,000
or iterations of a product

38
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:28,080
pat and bailey discover and communicate

39
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:30,240
the big picture of the product

40
00:01:28,080 --> 00:01:32,400
and the upcoming pieces that will be in

41
00:01:30,240 --> 00:01:34,320
the next focus area

42
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:36,960
pat needs to estimate and plan for

43
00:01:34,320 --> 00:01:40,400
resources and with bailey's help

44
00:01:36,960 --> 00:01:42,240
understands more about the product

45
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:44,159
bailey does planning related to

46
00:01:42,240 --> 00:01:45,520
requirements and business analysis

47
00:01:44,159 --> 00:01:48,000
process

48
00:01:45,520 --> 00:01:49,920
and this planning informs pat on

49
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:51,520
estimates and dependencies for the

50
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:53,759
analysis pieces

51
00:01:51,520 --> 00:01:55,040
and also has a critical role in

52
00:01:53,759 --> 00:01:57,439
stakeholders

53
00:01:55,040 --> 00:02:00,079
understanding what's expected of them

54
00:01:57,439 --> 00:02:02,240
and when

55
00:02:00,079 --> 00:02:03,759
bailey might have a ba plan with the

56
00:02:02,240 --> 00:02:06,960
analysis deliverables

57
00:02:03,759 --> 00:02:08,399
activities timelines and stakeholders

58
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:10,239
outlined

59
00:02:08,399 --> 00:02:11,680
bailey may also have a requirements

60
00:02:10,239 --> 00:02:13,840
management plan

61
00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:16,879
showing how decisions and requirements

62
00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:19,120
will be tracked and approved

63
00:02:16,879 --> 00:02:20,319
bailey also has models that serve as

64
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:23,120
assets to the team

65
00:02:20,319 --> 00:02:26,640
to show the product's scope context and

66
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:29,680
environment or ecosystem of the product

67
00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:32,400
all these help inform the project plan

68
00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:34,720
that pat is working on and all these are

69
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:36,319
great dialogue and collaboration points

70
00:02:34,720 --> 00:02:38,720
for pat and bailey

71
00:02:36,319 --> 00:02:40,720
they all tied together and need to be

72
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:43,040
aligned

73
00:02:40,720 --> 00:02:45,360
together pat and bailey work in

74
00:02:43,040 --> 00:02:48,800
leveraging their expertise and past

75
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:50,720
experiences in planning and estimating

76
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:53,040
pat and bailey also worked together on

77
00:02:50,720 --> 00:02:54,400
complexity and impact assessments for

78
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:56,239
the project

79
00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:58,080
together they look at the various

80
00:02:56,239 --> 00:03:00,159
aspects of complexity

81
00:02:58,080 --> 00:03:01,280
in how many areas and groups are

82
00:03:00,159 --> 00:03:02,959
impacted

83
00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:05,599
they look at the risk profile of the

84
00:03:02,959 --> 00:03:07,120
project and how big of a change it is

85
00:03:05,599 --> 00:03:09,519
for each group

86
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:11,440
this also informs the project plan and

87
00:03:09,519 --> 00:03:14,319
risk planning

88
00:03:11,440 --> 00:03:14,800
planning and estimating are key areas of

89
00:03:14,319 --> 00:03:17,599
pm

90
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:19,680
and ba collaboration it's hard to

91
00:03:17,599 --> 00:03:26,879
imagine a project being successful

92
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:26,879
without it
