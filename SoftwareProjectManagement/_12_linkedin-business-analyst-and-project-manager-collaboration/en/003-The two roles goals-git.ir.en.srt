1
00:00:00,960 --> 00:00:05,680
many wonder if one person
can be both the project manager and the

2
00:00:05,680 --> 00:00:09,679
ba on a project
it's an important question to ask and

3
00:00:09,679 --> 00:00:13,040
there are many factors that go into the
answer

4
00:00:13,040 --> 00:00:16,080
there are times when this can work and
also times

5
00:00:16,080 --> 00:00:21,600
i wouldn't recommend it let's look at
the essence of what each role does

6
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:26,960
a project manager is responsible for
delivering the work of the project

7
00:00:26,960 --> 00:00:31,760
this often includes defining the work
and delivering the work within a budget

8
00:00:31,760 --> 00:00:35,920
and schedule
with agreed upon quality levels a

9
00:00:35,920 --> 00:00:39,600
business analyst
is responsible for ensuring what the

10
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:43,120
project delivers
is valuable and meets the needs of the

11
00:00:43,120 --> 00:00:47,200
business and customers
without one of these roles chaos can

12
00:00:47,200 --> 00:00:51,199
break out
lackluster results can ensue or simply

13
00:00:51,199 --> 00:00:56,559
the project fails
if a project has a pm and no ba

14
00:00:56,559 --> 00:01:01,840
or no one performing the ba role or
perhaps the ba role isn't done well

15
00:01:01,840 --> 00:01:05,199
the project is at a high risk of
building the wrong

16
00:01:05,199 --> 00:01:09,920
thing this is realized when users get
the product

17
00:01:09,920 --> 00:01:14,159
and react that it's not what they needed
often it's too late

18
00:01:14,159 --> 00:01:17,600
and too much has been spent before
leaders realize

19
00:01:17,600 --> 00:01:20,799
that there's been waste in building the
wrong thing

20
00:01:20,799 --> 00:01:27,360
on the flip side if a project has a ba
and no pm or no one performing the pm

21
00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:30,479
role
or the pm role isn't done well the

22
00:01:30,479 --> 00:01:34,320
project has a high risk of running into
schedule and budget issues

23
00:01:34,320 --> 00:01:38,640
and the analysis takes too much priority
over the budget and schedule

24
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:41,920
or potentially decision making is
impeded

25
00:01:41,920 --> 00:01:47,840
by focus on other areas depending on the
project approach and methodology

26
00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:52,320
various factors and roles can influence
these dynamics

27
00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:55,759
each project is different and the
context can change

28
00:01:55,759 --> 00:02:01,759
everything for example some projects
follow a traditional approach with

29
00:02:01,759 --> 00:02:06,719
formal plans and formal documentation
and the size and complexity of the

30
00:02:06,719 --> 00:02:12,319
project can be a big factor
the larger the project the more a pm

31
00:02:12,319 --> 00:02:18,160
and or multiple bas are needed
if the project is quite small one person

32
00:02:18,160 --> 00:02:23,599
may be able to play both roles
on projects using a more agile approach

33
00:02:23,599 --> 00:02:26,560
the pm
role really depends on the enterprise

34
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:30,239
roles
and context and the ba rule typically

35
00:02:30,239 --> 00:02:34,000
depends on the complexity
as well as the product owner's

36
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:38,640
availability and skill set
having both roles represented is

37
00:02:38,640 --> 00:02:41,440
critical
and hopefully can lead to some healthy

38
00:02:41,440 --> 00:02:45,120
conflict
when what needs to be built conflicts

39
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:48,640
with the budget
and schedule needs this is a healthy

40
00:02:48,640 --> 00:02:52,959
conflict where both roles can balance
the decision-making process

41
00:02:52,959 --> 00:02:56,400
and help business leaders make critical
decisions

42
00:02:56,400 --> 00:03:02,840
this duo of PM and BA is an awesome duo
to provide projects with the balance to

43
00:03:02,840 --> 00:03:05,840
succeed
