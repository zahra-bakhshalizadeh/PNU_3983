1
00:00:00,680 --> 00:00:07,620
Pat, the PM feels like sometimes it takes
saying something 20 times before it's heard,

2
00:00:07,620 --> 00:00:13,260
and Pat leverages Bailey, the BA, to help
communicate some of these messages to the

3
00:00:13,260 --> 00:00:17,820
key is communicating when the listener is
receptive.

4
00:00:17,820 --> 00:00:19,720
And that's hard to pinpoint.

5
00:00:19,720 --> 00:00:21,350
So it's a good strategy.

6
00:00:21,350 --> 00:00:27,620
Many use to communicate things many times
in many different ways and also using others

7
00:00:27,620 --> 00:00:31,190
to help communicate the same message.

8
00:00:31,190 --> 00:00:37,210
This is true on projects as well as patent
collaborate to bring key messages to stakeholders

9
00:00:37,210 --> 00:00:43,540
and user groups impacted by the project, and
this communication can be simply tactical

10
00:00:43,540 --> 00:00:46,329
or quite strategic as well.

11
00:00:46,329 --> 00:00:51,510
This requires a lot of communication between
Pat and Bailey themselves.

12
00:00:51,510 --> 00:00:57,350
Pat and Bailey mainly collaborate to communicate
to the team, to create transparency and inspire

13
00:00:57,350 --> 00:00:59,489
engagement with the team.

14
00:00:59,489 --> 00:01:06,100
They communicate things like a shared understanding
of what requirements and intent.

15
00:01:06,100 --> 00:01:12,500
And what's the highest priorities the team
is working on the timelines and also a lot

16
00:01:12,500 --> 00:01:15,650
of detailed conversations.

17
00:01:15,650 --> 00:01:20,590
Pat and Bailey collaborate to look at ensuring
a consistent message is being communicated

18
00:01:20,590 --> 00:01:23,159
to each person or group.

19
00:01:23,159 --> 00:01:29,580
They also listen intently to stakeholder's,
watch other's body language and watch their

20
00:01:29,580 --> 00:01:34,650
own when communicating and sharing our learnings
with one another.

21
00:01:34,650 --> 00:01:40,740
This allows them to connect better with stakeholders,
build trust and create better relationships

22
00:01:40,740 --> 00:01:45,689
with the team and stakeholders.I resonate
with this.

23
00:01:45,689 --> 00:01:50,990
I often find myself sharing with the PM the
various discussions that came up and the key

24
00:01:50,990 --> 00:01:53,890
points and planning to have.

25
00:01:53,890 --> 00:01:58,610
Then she can check in with the same stakeholder
and seek to understand if the message was

26
00:01:58,610 --> 00:02:00,650
successful.

27
00:02:00,650 --> 00:02:05,570
Often there are opportunities to create another
communication and maybe a different manner

28
00:02:05,570 --> 00:02:11,099
with different words to try again to communicate
the same thing.

29
00:02:11,099 --> 00:02:15,269
This is a critical part of a PM and BA collaboration.

30
00:02:15,269 --> 00:02:21,650
Besides working with stakeholders, PMS and
BAs communicate a lot with each other.

31
00:02:21,650 --> 00:02:27,440
It's important to ensure as much transparency
in our work as possible to make this communication

32
00:02:27,440 --> 00:02:30,319
go smoothly.

33
00:02:30,319 --> 00:02:34,290
Transparency and things like what am I working
on?

34
00:02:34,290 --> 00:02:40,299
What are my priorities today, who I plan to
interact with and the key messages that we

35
00:02:40,299 --> 00:02:43,359
need to collaborate on?

36
00:02:43,359 --> 00:02:48,209
Communicating together to help get project
activities completed and influence others

37
00:02:48,209 --> 00:02:56,069
is what it's all about, you can choose to
communicate tactically or strategically.

38
00:02:56,069 --> 00:03:02,089
Strategic communication is all about thinking
one step ahead with what others need and working

39
00:03:02,089 --> 00:03:05,500
together on key messages that make all the
difference.
