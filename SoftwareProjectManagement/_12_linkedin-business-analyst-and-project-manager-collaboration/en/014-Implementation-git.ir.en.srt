1
00:00:00,960 --> 00:00:06,160
so requirements are done

2
00:00:03,439 --> 00:00:06,960
now what does implementation have to do

3
00:00:06,160 --> 00:00:10,400
with the ba

4
00:00:06,960 --> 00:00:12,880
and pm partnership bailey the ba

5
00:00:10,400 --> 00:00:14,400
has the requirements done helped with

6
00:00:12,880 --> 00:00:17,279
development and testing

7
00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:18,640
so what's next collaborating on

8
00:00:17,279 --> 00:00:20,960
implementation starts

9
00:00:18,640 --> 00:00:22,080
long before prepping for the go live day

10
00:00:20,960 --> 00:00:24,640
activities

11
00:00:22,080 --> 00:00:26,400
and the key areas where pat the pm and

12
00:00:24,640 --> 00:00:28,720
bayley the ba collaborate

13
00:00:26,400 --> 00:00:30,480
are the transition requirements and

14
00:00:28,720 --> 00:00:33,280
change readiness

15
00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:35,760
let's start with transition requirements

16
00:00:33,280 --> 00:00:38,640
these are the requirements that define

17
00:00:35,760 --> 00:00:40,480
what it takes to transition from the old

18
00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:42,960
to the new solution

19
00:00:40,480 --> 00:00:44,640
and bailey thinks about them often

20
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:46,879
they're things like

21
00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:48,879
what data needs to be brought from the

22
00:00:46,879 --> 00:00:51,600
old to the new solution

23
00:00:48,879 --> 00:00:53,280
so that it works as intended for users

24
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:56,559
and customers

25
00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:58,879
an example of this is customer data

26
00:00:56,559 --> 00:00:59,920
if a new system is implemented for an

27
00:00:58,879 --> 00:01:01,680
organization

28
00:00:59,920 --> 00:01:04,159
and none of the customer data is

29
00:01:01,680 --> 00:01:07,119
transitioned to the new system

30
00:01:04,159 --> 00:01:09,200
then when i interact as a customer the

31
00:01:07,119 --> 00:01:12,320
new system may not know who i am

32
00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:14,080
or my history this means customer

33
00:01:12,320 --> 00:01:17,040
service nor myself

34
00:01:14,080 --> 00:01:18,000
has information about me as a customer

35
00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:20,080
it may seem

36
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:22,080
far-reaching to think this gets

37
00:01:20,080 --> 00:01:25,200
forgotten or not done well

38
00:01:22,080 --> 00:01:28,000
but it happens more often than you think

39
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:29,920
or the team thinks it's taken care of

40
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:33,439
but the customer experience

41
00:01:29,920 --> 00:01:35,520
shows another view related to this

42
00:01:33,439 --> 00:01:36,560
is other data migrations of work in

43
00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:39,439
progress

44
00:01:36,560 --> 00:01:40,240
things like current orders and status

45
00:01:39,439 --> 00:01:42,399
data

46
00:01:40,240 --> 00:01:44,240
another area of transition and

47
00:01:42,399 --> 00:01:46,720
implementation preparation

48
00:01:44,240 --> 00:01:48,079
patent bailey collaborate on is change

49
00:01:46,720 --> 00:01:50,479
readiness

50
00:01:48,079 --> 00:01:51,680
this includes things like training the

51
00:01:50,479 --> 00:01:54,079
users

52
00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:55,200
communicating the changes to each group

53
00:01:54,079 --> 00:01:57,680
impacted

54
00:01:55,200 --> 00:02:00,000
and evaluating if those impacted are

55
00:01:57,680 --> 00:02:00,640
ready to make the change without adverse

56
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:03,680
impact

57
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:07,280
to the organization or customers

58
00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:09,280
and last the go no go decision

59
00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:10,319
facilitating the decision among

60
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:12,879
stakeholders of

61
00:02:10,319 --> 00:02:15,599
readiness to deploy is a partnership

62
00:02:12,879 --> 00:02:17,599
activity between pat and bailey

63
00:02:15,599 --> 00:02:19,040
both pat and bailey have relationships

64
00:02:17,599 --> 00:02:20,879
with the stakeholders

65
00:02:19,040 --> 00:02:23,360
and have perspectives on the end

66
00:02:20,879 --> 00:02:25,599
customer points of view

67
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:26,640
pat is looking closely at the triple

68
00:02:25,599 --> 00:02:29,440
constraint

69
00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:31,280
while bailly is analyzing the experience

70
00:02:29,440 --> 00:02:32,800
and impacts to user groups in the

71
00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:35,120
customer

72
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:37,760
all these pieces need to be taken into

73
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:40,959
account in these critical decisions

74
00:02:37,760 --> 00:02:43,200
and moments of implementation

75
00:02:40,959 --> 00:02:45,440
pat and bailey makes sure all the angles

76
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:48,080
are considered in the decision making

77
00:02:45,440 --> 00:02:49,200
and both pat and bailey have a powerful

78
00:02:48,080 --> 00:02:51,760
lens to provide

79
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:52,959
value together as the project heads

80
00:02:51,760 --> 00:03:01,840
towards hopefully

81
00:02:52,959 --> 00:03:01,840
a rewarding implementation
