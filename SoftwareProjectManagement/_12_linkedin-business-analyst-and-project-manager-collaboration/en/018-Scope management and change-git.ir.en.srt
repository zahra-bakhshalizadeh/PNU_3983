00:00:00,710 --> 00:00:06,680
I once heard a PM say that a project manager,
his biggest fear of a business analyst is

2
00:00:06,680 --> 00:00:08,250
scope creep.

3
00:00:08,250 --> 00:00:09,370
I get it.

4
00:00:09,370 --> 00:00:15,380
The PM is concerned that when eliciting requirements,
A BA will agree to stakeholder's requests

5
00:00:15,380 --> 00:00:20,810
for some more scope and the PM schedule and
budgeter that impacted.

6
00:00:20,810 --> 00:00:26,149
As I've grown in my BA career, I've also learned
to appreciate that some scope creep is good

7
00:00:26,149 --> 00:00:32,460
and needed, scope creep happens in many ways,
and no matter how it happens, it needs to

8
00:00:32,460 --> 00:00:35,359
be a collaborative discussion.

9
00:00:35,359 --> 00:00:40,980
Some scope creep is not great for projects
and some is absolutely needed to ensure that

10
00:00:40,980 --> 00:00:43,489
the solution delivers value.

11
00:00:43,489 --> 00:00:46,000
Let's dig into some more.

12
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:53,730
Pat the PM and Bailey the BA are working hard
on the CRM project with so many impacted groups

13
00:00:53,730 --> 00:00:59,170
as they understand more about what's coming
changes and what's needed are evolving and

14
00:00:59,170 --> 00:01:03,110
being discussed at a furious pace.

15
00:01:03,110 --> 00:01:08,350
Pat and Bailey must find a way to get all
of us under control, they worked together

16
00:01:08,350 --> 00:01:14,399
to define and manage the change process for
when they have changes to requirements.

17
00:01:14,399 --> 00:01:19,390
This is easier when iterations are short and
work in progress is small.

18
00:01:19,390 --> 00:01:22,600
Agile teams experience this with their work.

19
00:01:22,600 --> 00:01:28,310
However, teams that have a larger work in
progress and longer iterations need to manage

20
00:01:28,310 --> 00:01:34,590
change carefully.So what do Pat and Bailey
need to do to manage scope?

21
00:01:34,590 --> 00:01:39,640
Well, they agree on a baseline from which
changes will be managed.

22
00:01:39,640 --> 00:01:45,869
Then, when a potential change comes up, they
agree on how they'll do things like identify

23
00:01:45,869 --> 00:01:52,930
what the changes, discuss if it's feasible,
discuss if it's the right thing to do to get

24
00:01:52,930 --> 00:01:56,439
the outcome the project needs.

25
00:01:56,439 --> 00:02:01,630
Discuss the impact to the quality, scope,
budget and schedule.

26
00:02:01,630 --> 00:02:08,039
And bring options and a decision for the leaders
to make some techniques that help keep all

27
00:02:08,039 --> 00:02:09,039
of us organized.

28
00:02:09,039 --> 00:02:16,610
Are things like a change log and a decision
log to track changes and decisions and a change

29
00:02:16,610 --> 00:02:22,310
intake checklist to make sure Pat and Bailey
have the needed information to further develop

30
00:02:22,310 --> 00:02:29,630
the options and also a traceability matrix
which helps them see which requirements tied

31
00:02:29,630 --> 00:02:34,110
to what outcomes, teams, designs and tests.

32
00:02:34,110 --> 00:02:40,321
Together, Pat and Bailey make change an easy
process for the team and stakeholders, pat

33
00:02:40,321 --> 00:02:43,790
and Bailey trust one another with scope and
changes.

34
00:02:43,790 --> 00:02:49,880
The stakeholders see this and in turn, trust
them to bring the right decisions and options

35
00:02:49,880 --> 00:02:52,450
to leaders.

36
00:02:52,450 --> 00:02:57,920
Scope changes and scope management should
be a positive, not something to fear with

37
00:02:57,920 --> 00:03:03,440
the right mindset and collaboration, the right
scope will become more obvious to everyone.
