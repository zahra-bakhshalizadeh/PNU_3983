1
00:00:00,700 --> 00:00:05,939
When Bailey the BA first started out, not
much attention was given to risk management

2
00:00:05,939 --> 00:00:09,860
and many boys feel the same, it's a PM thing.

3
00:00:09,860 --> 00:00:15,769
Bailey found working closely with the PM that
the payroll had a lot to do with risk management

4
00:00:15,769 --> 00:00:19,600
and learned how to become an integral part
of it.

5
00:00:19,600 --> 00:00:25,930
Bailey found three main areas of risk that
helped a lot when collaborating with Pat stakeholder

6
00:00:25,930 --> 00:00:32,570
involvement, the risk of building the wrong
thing and risk schedule.

7
00:00:32,570 --> 00:00:38,120
Many studies have shown that a top risk for
projects is inadequate requirements.

8
00:00:38,120 --> 00:00:43,150
And they also show that the number one risk
to high quality requirements is lack of stakeholder

9
00:00:43,150 --> 00:00:45,970
involvement in this course.

10
00:00:45,970 --> 00:00:51,300
We've talked a lot about stakeholders and
how Pat and Bailey work together in communicating

11
00:00:51,300 --> 00:00:54,510
and managing stakeholder relationships.

12
00:00:54,510 --> 00:01:00,149
This comes full circle with risk management
as they work together to identify and mitigate

13
00:01:00,149 --> 00:01:06,560
or manage the risks of stakeholders who are
not engaged or not as engaged as we need them

14
00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:07,840
to be.

15
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:10,749
Have you ever had a challenge getting stakeholders
time?

16
00:01:10,749 --> 00:01:12,679
I know quite the question.

17
00:01:12,679 --> 00:01:14,939
I'm sure you have.

18
00:01:14,939 --> 00:01:21,380
The next big risk and what I'm quite passionate
about is the risk of building the wrong thing.

19
00:01:21,380 --> 00:01:27,340
This also includes the risk of simply not
delivering any value to users and to customers

20
00:01:27,340 --> 00:01:33,509
with what we build, even if it's exactly what
they asked for together.Pat and Bailey analyze

21
00:01:33,509 --> 00:01:40,539
context stakeholders and the organization
to ensure what's being built matters.

22
00:01:40,539 --> 00:01:46,270
And it's the right thing to build Pat and
Bailey's share learnings, bring curiosity

23
00:01:46,270 --> 00:01:52,279
to the team and facilitate shared understanding
with the team on the vision and the why behind

24
00:01:52,279 --> 00:01:54,369
the project.

25
00:01:54,369 --> 00:02:01,529
The team understanding the intent of what's
needed and why it's needed is so critical.

26
00:02:01,529 --> 00:02:06,409
The last crucial area of risk to collaborate
on is schedule.

27
00:02:06,409 --> 00:02:10,129
The work Bailey does can have a big impact
on the schedule.

28
00:02:10,129 --> 00:02:13,209
Pat is working hard to manage.

29
00:02:13,209 --> 00:02:18,980
Both must be transparent and their activities
and status, including impediments.

30
00:02:18,980 --> 00:02:22,370
I also want to talk a little bit about assumptions.

31
00:02:22,370 --> 00:02:29,900
Both Pat and Bailey elicit and track assumptions
and assumptions, if not true, become big risks.

32
00:02:29,900 --> 00:02:36,450
So like other areas, they make these transparent
and talk about them together to collaborate.

33
00:02:36,450 --> 00:02:43,180
Overall, PM's and BAs work together to draw
on each other's expertise and experience to

34
00:02:43,180 --> 00:02:48,640
ensure that risks are well understood and
so that the team and the leaders can make

35
00:02:48,640 --> 00:02:49,689
good decisions.
