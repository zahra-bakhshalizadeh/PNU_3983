1
00:00:00,599 --> 00:00:07,540
Scope is a big collaboration point for PMs
and BAs, I can't stress this enough, what

2
00:00:07,540 --> 00:00:11,910
most teams don't realize is what scope actually
means.

3
00:00:11,910 --> 00:00:17,570
Teams often focus on the project scope and
not enough on the product scope.

4
00:00:17,570 --> 00:00:22,310
We have an intuitive idea from experience
and there are also ways to think about scope

5
00:00:22,310 --> 00:00:27,940
that can help us work together to make scope
more clear, to manage.

6
00:00:27,940 --> 00:00:35,280
Pat the PM and Bailey the BA think about scope
and five ways project scope.

7
00:00:35,280 --> 00:00:36,809
Product scope.

8
00:00:36,809 --> 00:00:43,159
And functional scope, technical scope and
organizational scope, they have learned that

9
00:00:43,159 --> 00:00:48,289
a lot of teams are focused on the project
and technical scope and mistakenly neglecting

10
00:00:48,289 --> 00:00:51,579
the product and functional scope.

11
00:00:51,579 --> 00:00:57,859
The project scope, which includes the work
to be done and resources to do it, the tasks,

12
00:00:57,859 --> 00:01:03,170
the people and organizations performing the
activities to complete the project.

13
00:01:03,170 --> 00:01:09,070
Pat is focused on this scope, and Bailey provides
inputs from other scope areas that help Pat

14
00:01:09,070 --> 00:01:11,360
with that project scope.

15
00:01:11,360 --> 00:01:17,140
Next, the product scope, which is what the
project builds and can be looked at from a

16
00:01:17,140 --> 00:01:21,560
functional and technical point of view.

17
00:01:21,560 --> 00:01:27,939
Bailey is focused on the functional scope,
what features goals and functions the product,

18
00:01:27,939 --> 00:01:33,229
service or system will provide by the end
of the project, and the technical scope is

19
00:01:33,229 --> 00:01:34,880
about what technologies are impacted.

20
00:01:34,880 --> 00:01:40,630
Pat and Bailey work together on this with
a technical lead.

21
00:01:40,630 --> 00:01:46,340
The functional scope is where Bailey provides
a leadership role as input to pat managing

22
00:01:46,340 --> 00:01:47,340
scope.

23
00:01:47,340 --> 00:01:53,679
Overall as a whole, the functional scope provides
critical input to the other scope areas Pat

24
00:01:53,679 --> 00:02:01,640
needs and Bailey analyses, defines and communicates
this to create a shared understanding, missing

25
00:02:01,640 --> 00:02:05,630
functional scope, impact, schedule, resources
and budget.

26
00:02:05,630 --> 00:02:11,750
Pat and bailey are tied together in this area
to ensure a smooth scope, understanding and

27
00:02:11,750 --> 00:02:17,381
decision making.The organizational scope is
another area of scope that patent and Bailey

28
00:02:17,381 --> 00:02:24,030
collaborate on, as it involves understanding
what locations, units and groups of the organization

29
00:02:24,030 --> 00:02:26,260
are impacted.

30
00:02:26,260 --> 00:02:33,250
Another big scope concept is scope creep,
and at times it's Pat's biggest fear.

31
00:02:33,250 --> 00:02:38,870
Scope creep is when scope is added to the
deliverables, plans or promise to stakeholders

32
00:02:38,870 --> 00:02:44,870
without truly planning the impacts on resources,
costs and schedule.

33
00:02:44,870 --> 00:02:50,840
This can happen if the project approaches
scope creep as being a bad thing without prioritizing

34
00:02:50,840 --> 00:02:54,900
what can be removed to accommodate the scope
change.

35
00:02:54,900 --> 00:03:01,510
Scope creep can be Pat's nightmare and create
a lot of stress if not managed.

36
00:03:01,510 --> 00:03:08,840
Bailey, the BA can easily and unknowingly
create scope creep in conversations with stakeholders.

37
00:03:08,840 --> 00:03:14,170
Being aware of this dynamic and working with
Pat in these situations is critical.

38
00:03:14,170 --> 00:03:20,110
Scope creep can also be a positive thing if
managed well between Pat and Bailey.

39
00:03:20,110 --> 00:03:25,680
If a stakeholder discussion yields new features
that were not previously planned, there needs

40
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:32,180
to be an understanding of the value of the
feature in question and the priority of it.

41
00:03:32,180 --> 00:03:37,550
If it truly will make or break the value delivered
and it's a top priority, then it should be

42
00:03:37,550 --> 00:03:43,480
added to scope Pat , Bailey in the business,
leaders need to have dialoge to make a decision

43
00:03:43,480 --> 00:03:48,210
on priorities, risk, budget and schedule.

44
00:03:48,210 --> 00:03:54,380
It could mean scoping something else or increasing
the cost or even increasing the time to fit

45
00:03:54,380 --> 00:03:55,540
it in.

46
00:03:55,540 --> 00:04:01,210
The important part is that it's managed and
leveraged for value, not feared.

47
00:04:01,210 --> 00:04:07,480
I've created a scoping checklist for PMs and
BAs to use in collaboration with one another.

48
00:04:07,480 --> 00:04:11,400
This will help your team plan and manage scope.

49
00:04:11,400 --> 00:04:17,570
Remember, collaborate closely and don't be
afraid of scope creep, embrace it and manage

50
00:04:17,570 --> 00:04:17,790
it.
