1
00:00:00,719 --> 00:00:04,000
many confuse the terms project and

2
00:00:03,199 --> 00:00:06,640
product

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:07,680
is this something you've experienced too

4
00:00:06,640 --> 00:00:11,440
product

5
00:00:07,680 --> 00:00:14,160
project what's the difference a project

6
00:00:11,440 --> 00:00:15,360
is a temporary initiative to create a

7
00:00:14,160 --> 00:00:18,160
product

8
00:00:15,360 --> 00:00:18,720
and a product is something that delivers

9
00:00:18,160 --> 00:00:22,080
value

10
00:00:18,720 --> 00:00:22,720
as the result of a project it's easy to

11
00:00:22,080 --> 00:00:25,599
use them

12
00:00:22,720 --> 00:00:26,560
interchangeably in conversation yet in

13
00:00:25,599 --> 00:00:29,279
project work

14
00:00:26,560 --> 00:00:30,640
it's important to differentiate the

15
00:00:29,279 --> 00:00:33,840
focus of each of these

16
00:00:30,640 --> 00:00:37,680
is different the product lives on

17
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:40,559
while the project is temporary the pm

18
00:00:37,680 --> 00:00:42,719
focuses on the project and the ba

19
00:00:40,559 --> 00:00:45,280
focuses on the product

20
00:00:42,719 --> 00:00:46,399
let's look at pat the pm and bailey the

21
00:00:45,280 --> 00:00:49,440
ba

22
00:00:46,399 --> 00:00:50,640
pat the pm and bailey the ba are on a

23
00:00:49,440 --> 00:00:52,800
project together

24
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:55,039
looking to transform their customer

25
00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:58,239
relationship management processes

26
00:00:55,039 --> 00:01:00,239
or crm for short and improve customer

27
00:00:58,239 --> 00:01:03,120
relationships

28
00:01:00,239 --> 00:01:05,199
the organization built a legacy system

29
00:01:03,120 --> 00:01:07,360
years ago for crm

30
00:01:05,199 --> 00:01:08,479
and it's no longer cost effective to

31
00:01:07,360 --> 00:01:10,840
maintain

32
00:01:08,479 --> 00:01:12,080
nor is it meeting business goals and

33
00:01:10,840 --> 00:01:14,640
needs

34
00:01:12,080 --> 00:01:16,400
they decided to invest in a new system

35
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:18,560
and determine that purchasing

36
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:20,240
rather than building software is the

37
00:01:18,560 --> 00:01:22,960
approach to take

38
00:01:20,240 --> 00:01:24,400
the project is the initiative to make

39
00:01:22,960 --> 00:01:26,640
the change

40
00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:28,000
it's temporary and has completion

41
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:30,960
criteria

42
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:32,240
the product is the system and process

43
00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:35,280
that lives on

44
00:01:32,240 --> 00:01:37,920
after the project is complete the

45
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:40,720
project creates the product

46
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:42,320
it's common that smaller projects or a

47
00:01:40,720 --> 00:01:45,520
product team is formed

48
00:01:42,320 --> 00:01:48,399
to enhance the product as needed

49
00:01:45,520 --> 00:01:48,720
pat looks from the project perspective

50
00:01:48,399 --> 00:01:50,640
and

51
00:01:48,720 --> 00:01:53,600
bailey looks at the product point of

52
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:55,600
view for the crm project

53
00:01:53,600 --> 00:01:56,719
this has pat looking at the vendor

54
00:01:55,600 --> 00:02:00,079
management

55
00:01:56,719 --> 00:02:03,119
resources budget schedule

56
00:02:00,079 --> 00:02:06,000
and overall plans for the project

57
00:02:03,119 --> 00:02:07,040
bailey's focus is on the groups that are

58
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:09,520
impacted

59
00:02:07,040 --> 00:02:11,599
and how their usage and interaction with

60
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:14,239
the system changes

61
00:02:11,599 --> 00:02:17,040
bailey is also looking at how any end

62
00:02:14,239 --> 00:02:18,879
customer touch points may be impacted

63
00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:21,440
bailly's focus is working with

64
00:02:18,879 --> 00:02:22,000
stakeholders to understand how the new

65
00:02:21,440 --> 00:02:24,560
crm

66
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:26,400
package works and what it takes to make

67
00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:29,200
it work in their environment to serve

68
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:31,599
their operation and customers

69
00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:32,400
collaboration between patent bailly is

70
00:02:31,599 --> 00:02:34,640
critical

71
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:35,760
as they feed one another to get their

72
00:02:34,640 --> 00:02:39,440
work accomplished

73
00:02:35,760 --> 00:02:41,440
successfully bailey working to define

74
00:02:39,440 --> 00:02:44,080
the product and its requirements

75
00:02:41,440 --> 00:02:44,720
will run into scope questions and scope

76
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:46,720
questions

77
00:02:44,720 --> 00:02:48,879
feed the estimates and schedule that

78
00:02:46,720 --> 00:02:50,959
pat's working on

79
00:02:48,879 --> 00:02:52,560
changing priorities means changes to

80
00:02:50,959 --> 00:02:55,680
scope requirements

81
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:58,080
budget and schedule and an increase in

82
00:02:55,680 --> 00:03:00,480
risk for the project

83
00:02:58,080 --> 00:03:01,440
changing requirements involve both pat

84
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:03,760
and bailey

85
00:03:01,440 --> 00:03:06,800
working together to ensure the right

86
00:03:03,760 --> 00:03:08,800
expectations and value are delivered

87
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:10,400
pat and bailey work well together as a

88
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:12,239
team because they both

89
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:14,239
understand the difference between the

90
00:03:12,239 --> 00:03:16,080
project and the product

91
00:03:14,239 --> 00:03:17,760
and what it means to their roles and how

92
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:19,760
they work together

93
00:03:17,760 --> 00:03:21,360
they're in constant communication on

94
00:03:19,760 --> 00:03:24,000
areas where the project

95
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:26,000
and the product overlap and they play

96
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,720
off one another's work to get great

97
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:31,840
results

98
00:03:26,720 --> 00:03:31,840
for stakeholders
