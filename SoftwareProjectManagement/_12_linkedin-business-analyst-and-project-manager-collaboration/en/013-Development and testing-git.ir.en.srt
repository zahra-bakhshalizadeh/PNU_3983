1
00:00:00,799 --> 00:00:04,080
during the build and testing activities

2
00:00:02,800 --> 00:00:07,440
on projects

3
00:00:04,080 --> 00:00:09,519
pat the pm and bailey the ba collaborate

4
00:00:07,440 --> 00:00:10,719
to ensure the team has a shared

5
00:00:09,519 --> 00:00:13,120
understanding

6
00:00:10,719 --> 00:00:13,759
of what features and aspects of each

7
00:00:13,120 --> 00:00:16,000
feature

8
00:00:13,759 --> 00:00:17,840
are the highest priority and will be

9
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:21,039
most valuable to the users

10
00:00:17,840 --> 00:00:23,519
in the organization first

11
00:00:21,039 --> 00:00:24,480
let's look at the build activities which

12
00:00:23,519 --> 00:00:26,480
is all about

13
00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:27,599
collaborating with the developers on

14
00:00:26,480 --> 00:00:29,359
their questions

15
00:00:27,599 --> 00:00:32,320
and ensuring they have the right

16
00:00:29,359 --> 00:00:34,480
priorities and shared understanding

17
00:00:32,320 --> 00:00:36,719
here the intent of the requirements is

18
00:00:34,480 --> 00:00:39,120
to be the focus

19
00:00:36,719 --> 00:00:41,360
pat and bailey provide the delivery team

20
00:00:39,120 --> 00:00:44,239
context of what the user's reason for

21
00:00:41,360 --> 00:00:46,640
using the system and features are

22
00:00:44,239 --> 00:00:48,800
pat and bailey want the team to see the

23
00:00:46,640 --> 00:00:49,680
bigger picture of the user journey and

24
00:00:48,800 --> 00:00:52,320
goals

25
00:00:49,680 --> 00:00:53,760
and the developers want and need this

26
00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:55,520
too

27
00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:57,600
there are always questions about the

28
00:00:55,520 --> 00:00:58,800
requirements and what's being built from

29
00:00:57,600 --> 00:01:01,039
developers

30
00:00:58,800 --> 00:01:03,280
and developers feel under pressure to

31
00:01:01,039 --> 00:01:05,360
work fast

32
00:01:03,280 --> 00:01:06,479
pat and bailey work together to provide

33
00:01:05,360 --> 00:01:09,119
an environment of

34
00:01:06,479 --> 00:01:09,680
trust and communications to the delivery

35
00:01:09,119 --> 00:01:12,320
team

36
00:01:09,680 --> 00:01:13,200
that fosters an openness to discuss the

37
00:01:12,320 --> 00:01:16,560
what

38
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:18,560
and the why behind what's being built

39
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:20,479
much of this is already provided in the

40
00:01:18,560 --> 00:01:22,400
requirements and dialogue that has

41
00:01:20,479 --> 00:01:24,560
already taken place

42
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:26,880
and it's important to continue this

43
00:01:24,560 --> 00:01:29,040
dialogue as well

44
00:01:26,880 --> 00:01:31,680
the budget and schedule that pat cares

45
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:33,040
about is typically top of mind during

46
00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:36,079
these activities

47
00:01:33,040 --> 00:01:38,400
as the team looks towards implementation

48
00:01:36,079 --> 00:01:39,680
so there can be a natural conflict on

49
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:42,320
the team

50
00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:44,240
pat and bailey provide an environment to

51
00:01:42,320 --> 00:01:46,479
not just meet deadlines

52
00:01:44,240 --> 00:01:48,640
but to make sure the team builds what's

53
00:01:46,479 --> 00:01:51,280
intended

54
00:01:48,640 --> 00:01:53,600
it's also easy during these activities

55
00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:56,240
to neglect focus on the value and

56
00:01:53,600 --> 00:01:58,000
outcomes of what's being delivered

57
00:01:56,240 --> 00:01:59,520
the team's understanding of what the

58
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:02,560
desired outcomes are

59
00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:05,600
is where bailey plays a big role and pat

60
00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:07,360
needs to support this as well bailey

61
00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:09,360
also needs to support the budget and

62
00:02:07,360 --> 00:02:10,479
schedule conditions the team is working

63
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:13,120
under

64
00:02:10,479 --> 00:02:14,319
next are the testing activities and much

65
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:16,319
like development

66
00:02:14,319 --> 00:02:18,000
there's a lot of pressure on the team to

67
00:02:16,319 --> 00:02:19,920
meet deadlines

68
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:21,040
this means that the team needs to be

69
00:02:19,920 --> 00:02:23,840
focused on the most

70
00:02:21,040 --> 00:02:24,800
important areas and aspects that deliver

71
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:26,720
value

72
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:28,480
we can't test everything in every

73
00:02:26,720 --> 00:02:31,440
possible scenario

74
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:32,720
so how does the team know where to focus

75
00:02:31,440 --> 00:02:35,040
well bailey provides

76
00:02:32,720 --> 00:02:36,560
critical context and dialogue for the

77
00:02:35,040 --> 00:02:38,879
testing activities

78
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:40,560
to help the team focus on the right

79
00:02:38,879 --> 00:02:43,280
areas to test

80
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:45,200
and collaborates with pat and the team

81
00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:48,239
to make sure the schedule and budget

82
00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:51,360
are used in the right places

83
00:02:48,239 --> 00:02:52,640
both the ba and pm play critical roles

84
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:54,879
in communicating

85
00:02:52,640 --> 00:02:56,000
and supporting the shared understanding

86
00:02:54,879 --> 00:02:58,080
together

87
00:02:56,000 --> 00:03:00,959
and this makes the build and testing

88
00:02:58,080 --> 00:03:00,959
phases go much

89
00:03:02,840 --> 00:03:06,959
smoother

90
00:03:04,879 --> 00:03:06,959
you
