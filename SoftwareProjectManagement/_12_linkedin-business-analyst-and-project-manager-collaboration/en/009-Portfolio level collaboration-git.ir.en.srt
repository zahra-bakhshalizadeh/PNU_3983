1
00:00:00,719 --> 00:00:05,839
at the portfolio level pms

2
00:00:03,360 --> 00:00:07,759
and bas are working to define projects

3
00:00:05,839 --> 00:00:09,040
related to strategic goals of the

4
00:00:07,759 --> 00:00:11,120
organization

5
00:00:09,040 --> 00:00:13,679
and align the projects together as a

6
00:00:11,120 --> 00:00:15,759
group of related projects

7
00:00:13,679 --> 00:00:17,920
at times the intake of defects and

8
00:00:15,759 --> 00:00:20,560
enhancements get integrated into these

9
00:00:17,920 --> 00:00:22,640
portfolios as well

10
00:00:20,560 --> 00:00:25,119
project and program managers are looking

11
00:00:22,640 --> 00:00:27,439
at the budget and schedule linkages

12
00:00:25,119 --> 00:00:29,199
as well as overall strategic alignment

13
00:00:27,439 --> 00:00:32,480
of the project goals

14
00:00:29,199 --> 00:00:34,800
bas are looking at strategic alignment

15
00:00:32,480 --> 00:00:36,880
business architecture and the big

16
00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:39,440
picture of who is impacted

17
00:00:36,880 --> 00:00:42,000
and the value the groups need to get

18
00:00:39,440 --> 00:00:44,960
from these projects

19
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:46,160
our team members pat the pm and bayley

20
00:00:44,960 --> 00:00:48,239
the ba

21
00:00:46,160 --> 00:00:50,960
may be assigned to work on the portfolio

22
00:00:48,239 --> 00:00:53,360
level with other pms and bas

23
00:00:50,960 --> 00:00:56,640
or as part of the intake process to

24
00:00:53,360 --> 00:00:58,800
start up a large set of projects

25
00:00:56,640 --> 00:01:00,239
some key tactical things that pat and

26
00:00:58,800 --> 00:01:03,760
bailey collaborate on

27
00:01:00,239 --> 00:01:06,240
are first defining the problem or

28
00:01:03,760 --> 00:01:08,400
opportunity statement

29
00:01:06,240 --> 00:01:09,920
they create a shared understanding

30
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:12,479
together with the leaders

31
00:01:09,920 --> 00:01:14,400
on the problem or opportunity which

32
00:01:12,479 --> 00:01:17,439
helps with strategic alignment

33
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:19,759
as they look at the portfolio of work

34
00:01:17,439 --> 00:01:22,479
it also helps the team facilitate the

35
00:01:19,759 --> 00:01:24,560
dialogue as to prioritizing the work

36
00:01:22,479 --> 00:01:27,040
and defining the work into valuable

37
00:01:24,560 --> 00:01:29,600
pieces to deliver

38
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:31,600
next they work together to define the

39
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:32,880
value proposition for the impacted

40
00:01:31,600 --> 00:01:35,680
stakeholder groups

41
00:01:32,880 --> 00:01:36,000
and not forgetting about the customer

42
00:01:35,680 --> 00:01:38,560
they

43
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:39,280
think through each group and ask

44
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:42,079
research

45
00:01:39,280 --> 00:01:44,159
and discover how the project benefits

46
00:01:42,079 --> 00:01:47,200
the group

47
00:01:44,159 --> 00:01:48,479
and next they determine measurable goals

48
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:51,520
and objectives to help

49
00:01:48,479 --> 00:01:54,240
chart the course and keep scope tied and

50
00:01:51,520 --> 00:01:56,560
aligned to measurable outcomes

51
00:01:54,240 --> 00:01:59,119
it's not good enough to say we want to

52
00:01:56,560 --> 00:02:01,439
improve the customer experience

53
00:01:59,119 --> 00:02:02,640
we need to define more measurable

54
00:02:01,439 --> 00:02:04,719
outcomes

55
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:06,240
like what part of the customer

56
00:02:04,719 --> 00:02:08,080
experience or

57
00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:10,720
what measurement of the customer

58
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:13,920
experience are we targeting to improve

59
00:02:10,720 --> 00:02:15,760
and why also

60
00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:17,920
they work together to define what

61
00:02:15,760 --> 00:02:19,520
capabilities are missing to meet these

62
00:02:17,920 --> 00:02:22,319
goals

63
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:23,680
this may include new innovations new

64
00:02:22,319 --> 00:02:27,200
processes

65
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:30,000
new systems and new behaviors

66
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:31,360
it also may mean that new groups perform

67
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:34,000
new tasks

68
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:36,400
it may mean automation or the removal of

69
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:39,200
some capabilities

70
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:41,200
they focus capabilities back to how they

71
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:41,680
impact the customer's experience with

72
00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:44,720
using

73
00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:46,800
products and services and like you

74
00:02:44,720 --> 00:02:48,840
they have seen far too many projects

75
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:50,000
that create strategically crafted

76
00:02:48,840 --> 00:02:52,959
capabilities

77
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:56,319
at the expense of customers not happy

78
00:02:52,959 --> 00:02:58,640
with the impact to their experience

79
00:02:56,319 --> 00:03:01,200
another thing pat and bailey look at is

80
00:02:58,640 --> 00:03:04,000
the feasibility of the approach

81
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:05,040
feasibility can be technical cost

82
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:07,840
related

83
00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:10,800
schedule related and also about the

84
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:13,519
business design and people factors

85
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:14,319
truly challenging assumptions on what is

86
00:03:13,519 --> 00:03:17,760
and is not

87
00:03:14,319 --> 00:03:20,080
feasible really matters

88
00:03:17,760 --> 00:03:22,239
regards to cost feasibility

89
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:23,599
organizations define this in various

90
00:03:22,239 --> 00:03:26,560
ways

91
00:03:23,599 --> 00:03:28,080
some organizations ask themselves how

92
00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:30,799
much will it cost

93
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:33,599
and how much will i get in return and

94
00:03:30,799 --> 00:03:34,080
some ask what am i willing to spend to

95
00:03:33,599 --> 00:03:36,799
get this

96
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:39,120
done there are various methods

97
00:03:36,799 --> 00:03:42,239
calculations and terms for this

98
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:43,760
things like return on investment net

99
00:03:42,239 --> 00:03:47,120
present value

100
00:03:43,760 --> 00:03:50,159
business case cost of delay

101
00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:52,879
and weighted shortest job first

102
00:03:50,159 --> 00:03:53,680
at a minimum i like to look at how the

103
00:03:52,879 --> 00:03:57,360
project would

104
00:03:53,680 --> 00:03:58,319
increase revenue reduce risk or reduce

105
00:03:57,360 --> 00:04:01,920
cost

106
00:03:58,319 --> 00:04:05,599
and then how much is the likely cost and

107
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:09,120
likely benefit a table like this can be

108
00:04:05,599 --> 00:04:12,239
a simple way to view this

109
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:15,519
here we can see the range of cost

110
00:04:12,239 --> 00:04:18,639
minimum likely and maximum

111
00:04:15,519 --> 00:04:20,160
and the same range for benefit now how

112
00:04:18,639 --> 00:04:22,240
much detail is behind this

113
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:24,800
is up to you the project manager and

114
00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:27,199
sponsors

115
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:29,919
prioritizing the items in a portfolio is

116
00:04:27,199 --> 00:04:31,919
the last piece of the equation

117
00:04:29,919 --> 00:04:33,919
pat and bailey work together to help

118
00:04:31,919 --> 00:04:34,880
business leaders make prioritization

119
00:04:33,919 --> 00:04:36,960
decisions

120
00:04:34,880 --> 00:04:39,680
by helping leaders participate in the

121
00:04:36,960 --> 00:04:42,479
various activities we've discussed

122
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:45,919
the idea is to make decision making

123
00:04:42,479 --> 00:04:48,080
easier and with higher quality decisions

124
00:04:45,919 --> 00:04:49,759
it's about making priorities and

125
00:04:48,080 --> 00:04:52,320
decisions flexible

126
00:04:49,759 --> 00:04:53,120
by defining independent and valuable

127
00:04:52,320 --> 00:04:55,680
pieces

128
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:58,080
that are not dependent on other projects

129
00:04:55,680 --> 00:05:00,320
and this gives leaders the flexibility

130
00:04:58,080 --> 00:05:02,000
to adapt as needed

131
00:05:00,320 --> 00:05:04,160
pat and bailey are part of an

132
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:05,840
organization where bailey has an active

133
00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:08,080
role in this process

134
00:05:05,840 --> 00:05:10,800
since the intake process requires a lot

135
00:05:08,080 --> 00:05:13,759
of analysis to make the right decisions

136
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:14,240
bailey's role is critical bailey helps

137
00:05:13,759 --> 00:05:16,320
ensure

138
00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:19,280
the organization is working on the right

139
00:05:16,320 --> 00:05:21,680
stuff at the right time

140
00:05:19,280 --> 00:05:22,880
working together on this with a blend of

141
00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:26,000
skills pms

142
00:05:22,880 --> 00:05:28,639
and bas bring to the table can benefit

143
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:30,720
portfolio planning in big ways

144
00:05:28,639 --> 00:05:32,880
it can bring a powerful decision-making

145
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:39,840
process to strategic alignment

146
00:05:32,880 --> 00:05:41,919
that can make all the difference

147
00:05:39,840 --> 00:05:41,919
you
