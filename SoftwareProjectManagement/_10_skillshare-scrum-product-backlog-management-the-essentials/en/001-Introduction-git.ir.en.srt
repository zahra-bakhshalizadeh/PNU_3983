Hi

2
00:00:01,024 --> 00:00:05,632
I'm Bertil Muth and this is scrum product backlog management, The essentilas

3
00:00:06,144 --> 00:00:12,288
The theory of backlog management is defined in the scrum guide I put a link to it in the about section of this class

4
00:00:13,824 --> 00:00:14,848
Is the practice

5
00:00:15,360 --> 00:00:16,128
Can get tricky sometimes

6
00:00:17,408 --> 00:00:22,016
So instead of just teaching you the concepts of backlog management

7
00:00:22,272 --> 00:00:24,832
I will walk you through a consistent example

8
00:00:25,344 --> 00:00:26,880
From the product Vision

9
00:00:27,136 --> 00:00:29,696
to discovering high level stories

10
00:00:30,208 --> 00:00:33,280
to using a technique called story mapping

11
00:00:33,792 --> 00:00:35,840
To derive the more detail

12
00:00:36,096 --> 00:00:39,936
Stories and I will also teach you what to do in the scrum events

13
00:00:40,960 --> 00:00:47,104
As this is an intermediate level class you should have a basic understanding of how

14
00:00:47,360 --> 00:00:48,384
agile Software development and scrum

15
00:00:49,152 --> 00:00:49,664
Works

16
00:00:50,176 --> 00:00:54,272
If you need a short recap please watch my class agile

17
00:00:54,528 --> 00:00:55,552
and scrum for beginners

18
00:00:56,320 --> 00:00:57,088
And now

19
00:00:57,600 --> 00:00:58,880
Without further ado,

20
00:00:59,392 --> 00:00:59,904
Let's begin.
