1
00:00:01,280 --> 00:00:06,912
Before you create an initial product backlog, your team should have a shared vision of the product to develop

2
00:00:07,936 --> 00:00:11,520
while the product vision is not an official artifact of scrum

3
00:00:11,776 --> 00:00:14,080
it Can help set the goal that everybody can agrees on

4
00:00:14,848 --> 00:00:18,176
Customer management, the product owner and developer

5
00:00:18,944 --> 00:00:22,016
A good vision motivates the people working on the product

6
00:00:22,272 --> 00:00:24,576
And it helps make scope decisions later on

7
00:00:25,088 --> 00:00:27,392
What to put into the product and whatnot

8
00:00:28,160 --> 00:00:30,976
That's why it is relevant for backlog management as well

9
00:00:32,512 --> 00:00:36,352
As Ken Schwaber one of the fathers of Scrum once put it

10
00:00:36,608 --> 00:00:39,936
The minimum plan necessary to start a scrum project

11
00:00:40,192 --> 00:00:42,752
Consists of a vision and a product backlog

12
00:00:44,288 --> 00:00:48,128
It's the product owner who leads the effort to come up with a product vision

13
00:00:48,640 --> 00:00:52,224
It is created in close collaboration with the rest of the scrum team

14
00:00:52,480 --> 00:00:52,992
And other stakeholders

15
00:00:54,272 --> 00:01:00,160
Since this is a class about backlog management will focus on a very simple format for documenting the vision

16
00:01:00,416 --> 00:01:01,440
The vision statement

17
00:01:02,208 --> 00:01:04,000
A more sophisticated format

18
00:01:04,256 --> 00:01:05,536
to Create a product vision

19
00:01:05,792 --> 00:01:07,840
It's roman pichler product vision board

20
00:01:08,352 --> 00:01:11,168
You find a link to it in the about section of the class

21
00:01:12,704 --> 00:01:17,056
Let's say your company wants to develop an online portal for booking flights

22
00:01:17,312 --> 00:01:18,592
Specifically targeted

23
00:01:18,848 --> 00:01:19,616
Frequent flyers

24
00:01:20,896 --> 00:01:22,432
Your vision statement Madrid

25
00:01:22,944 --> 00:01:23,968
Frequent flyer

26
00:01:24,224 --> 00:01:26,272
Fly often cheap and comfortable

27
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:30,624
In that statement you recognize Key properties of a vision

28
00:01:31,136 --> 00:01:32,160
It should be short

29
00:01:32,672 --> 00:01:34,976
That enables you to focus your development

30
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,304
You should point out for your Target user groups

31
00:01:38,816 --> 00:01:39,584
In this case freak

32
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:40,352
Open Flyers

33
00:01:40,864 --> 00:01:44,192
And it should state what users needs to have addressed

34
00:01:44,448 --> 00:01:44,960
by the product

35
00:01:45,216 --> 00:01:45,728
They want to fly

36
00:01:45,984 --> 00:01:47,264
often cheap and comfortable

37
00:01:48,288 --> 00:01:54,432
Once you have created a product Vision you should make it visible to the stakeholders for example printed out

38
00:01:54,688 --> 00:01:56,224
Old and hang it in your team room

39
00:01:56,736 --> 00:02:00,064
Once the stakeholders have agreed on a product vision

40
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:03,392
You can start creating an initial product backlog
