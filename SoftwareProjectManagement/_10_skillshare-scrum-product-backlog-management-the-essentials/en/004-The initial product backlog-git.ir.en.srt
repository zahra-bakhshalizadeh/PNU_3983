1
00:00:00,200 --> 00:00:03,299
You need an initial product backlog as the starting point

2
00:00:03,399 --> 00:00:06,199
for scrum based on the high-level stories.

3
00:00:06,299 --> 00:00:08,300
You can create the initial backlog.

4
00:00:08,599 --> 00:00:11,599
I like a technique called story mapping to do that and

5
00:00:11,699 --> 00:00:14,099
I'll show you how to use it by example.

6
00:00:14,699 --> 00:00:15,599
Let's revisit.

7
00:00:15,699 --> 00:00:17,000
The high-level stories.

8
00:00:17,199 --> 00:00:20,200
The first thing to do is to extract the features from

9
00:00:20,300 --> 00:00:21,100
the stories.

10
00:00:21,399 --> 00:00:23,200
If you do that in our example,

11
00:00:23,300 --> 00:00:26,200
you get three features book flight get

12
00:00:26,300 --> 00:00:29,599
discount and rebook flight easily What

13
00:00:29,699 --> 00:00:32,799
would Happen now in practice is that your scrum team meets

14
00:00:32,899 --> 00:00:36,199
for a story mapping Workshop the team notices

15
00:00:36,299 --> 00:00:39,399
that booking a flight is the core workflow that everything

16
00:00:39,500 --> 00:00:40,700
else depends upon.

17
00:00:41,100 --> 00:00:44,600
So the team writes book flight on an orange sticky note.

18
00:00:45,100 --> 00:00:48,199
It's orange as it is a user activity or in other

19
00:00:48,299 --> 00:00:51,199
words a workflow with multiple tasks to be

20
00:00:51,299 --> 00:00:52,700
performed by users.

21
00:00:53,899 --> 00:00:56,600
What do users need to do to book a flight?

22
00:00:58,200 --> 00:01:01,399
Let's say to book a flight a user needs to register

23
00:01:01,500 --> 00:01:02,799
or login First.

24
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:06,499
So the team Hanks that sticky note on the left and subsequent

25
00:01:06,599 --> 00:01:09,800
tasks to the right of it after logging

26
00:01:09,900 --> 00:01:11,500
in She searches flights.

27
00:01:11,799 --> 00:01:14,699
Then she picks a flight then she enters

28
00:01:14,799 --> 00:01:17,699
payment information and finally she confirms

29
00:01:17,799 --> 00:01:18,500
the booking.

30
00:01:19,900 --> 00:01:23,100
What about the other features you extracted earlier get

31
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:25,299
discount and rebook flight easily.

32
00:01:25,900 --> 00:01:26,899
The team's decides.

33
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:30,799
They should not be treated as user activities.

34
00:01:30,900 --> 00:01:34,200
But as user tasks that aren't really separate workflows.

35
00:01:34,500 --> 00:01:38,099
So the team integrates them in the book flight activity.

36
00:01:39,900 --> 00:01:43,799
Here's the new book flight activity with all features integrated.

37
00:01:45,099 --> 00:01:48,699
In any real-world application there will be more user activities.

38
00:01:48,799 --> 00:01:52,099
For example one activity to manage the account

39
00:01:52,400 --> 00:01:55,699
orange sticky notes are ordered left to right in the sequence.

40
00:01:55,799 --> 00:01:59,000
They occur same as with the blue user tasks.

41
00:01:59,700 --> 00:02:02,600
Now that we've got the activities and tasks the

42
00:02:02,700 --> 00:02:04,900
so-called backbone of the story map.

43
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:07,700
We can start discovering the user stories.

44
00:02:08,599 --> 00:02:11,800
You are team brainstorms what to do and arranges the stories

45
00:02:11,900 --> 00:02:15,099
below the backbone you think about what to implement

46
00:02:15,199 --> 00:02:17,400
first for the book flight activity.

47
00:02:17,699 --> 00:02:20,599
What would be a minimum solution that shows you're on

48
00:02:20,699 --> 00:02:21,699
the right track?

49
00:02:23,500 --> 00:02:25,500
Here's what the team comes up with.

50
00:02:25,800 --> 00:02:26,999
You can search for flights,

51
00:02:27,099 --> 00:02:29,599
but only the flights of a single Airline.

52
00:02:29,900 --> 00:02:32,899
You can pick a flight by a simple click and then you are directed

53
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:34,099
to the payment.

54
00:02:34,300 --> 00:02:37,399
You can only pay with visa and confirm it with a simple

55
00:02:37,500 --> 00:02:38,400
button press.

56
00:02:40,199 --> 00:02:41,000
After that,

57
00:02:41,300 --> 00:02:44,599
the developers will implement the login for convenience.

58
00:02:44,900 --> 00:02:47,999
They will Implement searching for another airline when

59
00:02:48,099 --> 00:02:51,300
the user picks a flight the software shows details about

60
00:02:51,400 --> 00:02:54,400
it and you can pay with another credit card.

61
00:02:55,400 --> 00:02:58,499
And finally the developers will Implement searching

62
00:02:58,599 --> 00:03:01,499
various Airlines the software calculates and

63
00:03:01,599 --> 00:03:02,900
shows the discount.

64
00:03:03,099 --> 00:03:05,300
You can pay with several credit cards,

65
00:03:05,400 --> 00:03:08,300
and there's a whole page summarizing the booking details

66
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:09,500
for you to confirm.

67
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:13,899
As you can see the vertical axis determines the

68
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,899
order of implementation stories at the top

69
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:19,899
are implemented first stories at the bottom are

70
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:23,099
implemented last instead of building the software

71
00:03:23,199 --> 00:03:24,099
in one goal.

72
00:03:24,199 --> 00:03:27,199
You build it up a territory flee and incrementally

73
00:03:27,300 --> 00:03:29,400
to reduce development risk.

74
00:03:30,900 --> 00:03:33,599
Once a team has built the stories on this map.

75
00:03:33,800 --> 00:03:36,800
They ship the software to test users to get feedback.

76
00:03:36,900 --> 00:03:40,399
If the software is very open and

77
00:03:40,500 --> 00:03:41,300
there you are.

78
00:03:41,400 --> 00:03:43,800
You've created the initial product backlog.

79
00:03:44,199 --> 00:03:44,300
Now,

80
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:48,300
you may be wondering isn't the scrum backlog of flat ordered lists.

81
00:03:49,199 --> 00:03:49,899
That's right,

82
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,999
and it's quite easy to convert the two-dimensional story

83
00:03:53,099 --> 00:03:56,099
map to a one-dimensional scrum backlog you

84
00:03:56,199 --> 00:03:59,800
simply number the stories from left to right and top to bottom.

85
00:04:00,300 --> 00:04:02,900
That's the rank of your product backlog items.

86
00:04:03,300 --> 00:04:03,700
Of course,

87
00:04:03,800 --> 00:04:06,300
you can shift things around horizontally.

88
00:04:07,400 --> 00:04:10,399
I prefer the two-dimensional story map as a backlog

89
00:04:10,500 --> 00:04:13,499
though as it is a nice overview of the things

90
00:04:13,599 --> 00:04:14,699
to be developed.
