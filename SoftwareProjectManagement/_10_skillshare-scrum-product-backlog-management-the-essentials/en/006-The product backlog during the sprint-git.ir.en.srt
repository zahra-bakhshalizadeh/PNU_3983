1
00:00:00,599 --> 00:00:03,799
What happens to the product backlog during the Sprint

2
00:00:04,200 --> 00:00:07,199
as I said before, in Sprint planning the developers

3
00:00:07,299 --> 00:00:11,000
put the top product backlog items to the Sprint backlog.

4
00:00:11,300 --> 00:00:15,099
So they are removed from the product backlog, after

5
00:00:15,199 --> 00:00:15,899
Sprint planning.

6
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:19,000
The so-called backlog refinement kicks in the

7
00:00:19,100 --> 00:00:22,099
product owner talks to users developers and other

8
00:00:22,199 --> 00:00:25,300
stakeholders about the future of the product.

9
00:00:25,500 --> 00:00:28,599
The activities are similar to what we discussed for

10
00:00:28,699 --> 00:00:31,800
Sprint planning with the differences that you

11
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:35,000
don't plan the current Sprint you plan one or

12
00:00:35,100 --> 00:00:36,600
two sprints ahead.

13
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:37,899
So for example,

14
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:41,199
in order to satisfy the stakeholders the product

15
00:00:41,299 --> 00:00:44,199
owner may decide to implement payment

16
00:00:44,299 --> 00:00:46,600
with the different credit card first.

17
00:00:48,399 --> 00:00:51,299
In Sprint review the developers demonstrate

18
00:00:51,399 --> 00:00:52,600
the working software.

19
00:00:52,700 --> 00:00:55,699
They built during the Sprint the product owner

20
00:00:55,799 --> 00:00:58,799
the developers and other invited stakeholders

21
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:02,500
discuss what has been achieved and what should be done next

22
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:06,500
as a result of this the product backlog may change

23
00:01:06,900 --> 00:01:10,000
for example in the first Sprint the developers

24
00:01:10,200 --> 00:01:11,400
got the search done.

25
00:01:11,700 --> 00:01:14,600
They also got the payment down because they could reuse

26
00:01:14,700 --> 00:01:16,200
it from another product,

27
00:01:16,500 --> 00:01:19,399
but they did not manage to Actually booked a flight

28
00:01:19,500 --> 00:01:22,399
with another airline that turned out to be more

29
00:01:22,500 --> 00:01:24,599
challenging than expected.

30
00:01:25,299 --> 00:01:28,199
The product owner has a choice completely

31
00:01:28,299 --> 00:01:31,199
discard the story or put it back in the backlog at

32
00:01:31,299 --> 00:01:34,600
a certain position maybe with changed acceptance

33
00:01:34,700 --> 00:01:36,899
criteria in the example.

34
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:40,200
She decides that booking a flight with another airline

35
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:43,300
should be implemented in the next Sprint as it

36
00:01:43,400 --> 00:01:45,700
is part of the core functionality.

37
00:01:46,599 --> 00:01:49,499
and that's what you do to the product backlog during

38
00:01:49,599 --> 00:01:49,799
the sprint.
