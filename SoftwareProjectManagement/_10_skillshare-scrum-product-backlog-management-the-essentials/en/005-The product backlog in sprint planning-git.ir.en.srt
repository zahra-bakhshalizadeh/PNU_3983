1
00:00:00,699 --> 00:00:03,700
What happens to the product backlog and Sprint planning

2
00:00:04,099 --> 00:00:07,199
in Sprint planning at the beginning of the Sprint the product

3
00:00:07,299 --> 00:00:10,499
owner discusses the stories at the top of the product backlog

4
00:00:10,599 --> 00:00:13,800
with the developers the developers forecast

5
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:16,899
how many they are likely to get done during the Sprint

6
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:20,099
to be able to do the forecast the details

7
00:00:20,199 --> 00:00:22,200
of the stories need to be understood well enough,

8
00:00:22,300 --> 00:00:25,299
they should be the result of a negotiation between

9
00:00:25,399 --> 00:00:28,299
the product owner and the developers and they should

10
00:00:28,399 --> 00:00:30,199
be documented as acceptance criteria.

11
00:00:30,399 --> 00:00:30,899
Here we are.

12
00:00:32,299 --> 00:00:33,000
Also.

13
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:36,100
The story should be small so that the developers can

14
00:00:36,200 --> 00:00:38,899
show the progress they made in Sprint review.

15
00:00:39,200 --> 00:00:42,100
They should be around five to ten stories available for the

16
00:00:42,200 --> 00:00:45,100
Sprint furthermore the team agrees on

17
00:00:45,200 --> 00:00:48,399
an overarching goal for the Sprint the developers

18
00:00:48,500 --> 00:00:52,100
to the design and agree on tasks to implement the stories.

19
00:00:53,899 --> 00:00:57,000
Let's have a look at our top story from the example backlog

20
00:00:57,100 --> 00:01:00,000
search single Airline when the product owner meets

21
00:01:00,100 --> 00:01:00,799
the developers.

22
00:01:00,899 --> 00:01:02,500
He has a lot of ideas.

23
00:01:03,100 --> 00:01:05,399
The airline is fixed to United Airlines.

24
00:01:05,500 --> 00:01:08,399
The frequent flyer can specify source and Target

25
00:01:08,500 --> 00:01:11,499
airport day of departure and return how many adults

26
00:01:11,599 --> 00:01:14,699
and children will fly and which class they will fly in the

27
00:01:14,799 --> 00:01:18,399
product owner wants the source and Target airport is autocomplete

28
00:01:18,500 --> 00:01:21,399
fields and the day of departure and return to be

29
00:01:21,500 --> 00:01:22,799
picked from a calendar.

30
00:01:23,700 --> 00:01:27,000
In the discussion with the developers it quickly turns out

31
00:01:27,099 --> 00:01:30,200
that this story is too big for a two-week Sprint.

32
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:32,400
So the team starts to brainstorm.

33
00:01:32,700 --> 00:01:35,700
What would be the simplest thing to do with the story?

34
00:01:38,099 --> 00:01:40,999
Here's what the team agrees on the airline is

35
00:01:41,099 --> 00:01:43,999
fixed to United Airlines same as before but

36
00:01:44,099 --> 00:01:47,300
the source and Target airport are specified a simple text

37
00:01:47,400 --> 00:01:50,300
Fields without autocomplete only the day of

38
00:01:50,400 --> 00:01:52,100
departure can be specified.

39
00:01:52,200 --> 00:01:54,799
So at first only single trips are possible.

40
00:01:55,299 --> 00:01:58,199
The user needs to enter the date in a simple text field.

41
00:01:58,299 --> 00:02:01,300
There's no calendar only one adult can fly

42
00:02:01,400 --> 00:02:04,099
that is fixed in the class is fixed to coach.

43
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,999
On top of that the developers create a simple wire

44
00:02:09,099 --> 00:02:11,500
frame to show what the page will look like.

45
00:02:12,199 --> 00:02:12,800
Of course.

46
00:02:12,900 --> 00:02:15,800
This story does not represent the final story that will

47
00:02:15,900 --> 00:02:17,800
be delivered to end users.

48
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:21,200
It does not have to it's part of the iterative nature

49
00:02:21,300 --> 00:02:24,499
of scrum to refine the work that has been done Sprint

50
00:02:24,599 --> 00:02:25,400
by Sprint.

51
00:02:27,400 --> 00:02:30,499
The team agrees on the Sprint goal to be able to book

52
00:02:30,599 --> 00:02:33,700
a flight of a single airline to reach that goal

53
00:02:33,800 --> 00:02:36,999
the team can stop discussing further details of the third

54
00:02:37,099 --> 00:02:38,200
single Airline story.

55
00:02:38,300 --> 00:02:38,800
Now,

56
00:02:39,099 --> 00:02:42,499
this will be done in the future when the team has more knowledge

57
00:02:42,599 --> 00:02:46,099
based on the implementation and feedback of the stakeholders

58
00:02:46,500 --> 00:02:49,800
instead the team starts to discuss the other stories

59
00:02:49,900 --> 00:02:53,200
needed to book a flight and defines acceptance criteria

60
00:02:53,300 --> 00:02:54,300
for them as well.

61
00:02:55,400 --> 00:02:58,499
But what about the original story the full version

62
00:02:58,599 --> 00:03:01,599
of the search that will become clear when we look

63
00:03:01,699 --> 00:03:04,599
at the story map that is updated by the team and

64
00:03:04,699 --> 00:03:05,699
Sprint planning.

65
00:03:07,900 --> 00:03:10,800
The product owner decides to put that story at

66
00:03:10,900 --> 00:03:12,699
the very bottom of the map.

67
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:16,700
Maybe you think now why on Earth is dead remember

68
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:19,999
that the goal of the release was to ship a usable software

69
00:03:20,099 --> 00:03:23,399
to test users to see if it's valuable the

70
00:03:23,500 --> 00:03:26,400
product owner understands that to reach their goal.

71
00:03:26,500 --> 00:03:29,599
The UI does not need to be polished or perfect.

72
00:03:29,800 --> 00:03:33,200
So the story gets a lower priority its details

73
00:03:33,300 --> 00:03:36,599
will be defined in a future Sprint when it will be implemented.

74
00:03:38,800 --> 00:03:42,400
When the team has discussed the stories for the Sprint

75
00:03:42,500 --> 00:03:45,599
the developers are confident that they are able to deliver

76
00:03:45,699 --> 00:03:46,599
those stories.

77
00:03:46,900 --> 00:03:50,500
So the pull the stories into the Sprint backlog.

78
00:03:50,900 --> 00:03:54,200
They discuss the necessary development tasks to implement

79
00:03:54,300 --> 00:03:57,900
the stories you can see them in the to do column.

80
00:03:58,400 --> 00:04:01,700
The development tasks are different from the user tasks

81
00:04:01,800 --> 00:04:02,700
in story mapping.

82
00:04:02,800 --> 00:04:05,899
Our development has could be create controller

83
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:07,599
Class A create.

84
00:04:07,800 --> 00:04:10,500
InDesign be or create see service.

85
00:04:11,300 --> 00:04:14,199
And with that Sprint planning is complete.
