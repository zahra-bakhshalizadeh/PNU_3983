00:00:00,699 --> 00:00:02,399
Once you've got a product Vision,

2
00:00:02,500 --> 00:00:05,399
you can start discovering high level user stories

3
00:00:05,500 --> 00:00:08,499
based on your users needs before I start

4
00:00:08,599 --> 00:00:08,899
with it.

5
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:10,300
Here's a disclaimer.

6
00:00:10,699 --> 00:00:13,700
There are many ways to manage your product backlog in

7
00:00:13,800 --> 00:00:14,499
this class.

8
00:00:14,599 --> 00:00:17,500
I will show you my preferred way while I am

9
00:00:17,600 --> 00:00:18,600
convinced of it.

10
00:00:18,699 --> 00:00:21,700
Please experiment with it and find your own way

11
00:00:21,800 --> 00:00:22,399
that fits.

12
00:00:22,500 --> 00:00:22,899
Well,

13
00:00:24,399 --> 00:00:27,399
let's revisit the example vision statement

14
00:00:27,500 --> 00:00:29,800
fly often cheap and comfortable.

15
00:00:30,500 --> 00:00:32,200
Other needs hidden in it.

16
00:00:32,899 --> 00:00:35,199
If a person chooses to fly by plane,

17
00:00:35,299 --> 00:00:38,600
she usually needs to travel to a distant location.

18
00:00:39,200 --> 00:00:42,100
If she travels quite often that can be become

19
00:00:42,200 --> 00:00:43,500
quite expensive.

20
00:00:43,799 --> 00:00:47,199
So she has the need to save money either for herself

21
00:00:47,299 --> 00:00:50,199
or for the company she works for and as she

22
00:00:50,299 --> 00:00:53,199
needs to organize trips often doing so

23
00:00:53,299 --> 00:00:54,600
should be comfortable.

24
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:55,699
For example,

25
00:00:55,799 --> 00:00:57,799
the software should be easy to use.

26
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:03,100
So why even bother to think about the needs of the users?

27
00:01:03,399 --> 00:01:06,099
Why not jump right into developing features?

28
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:08,899
Well when people use your software,

29
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:11,999
they don't do it because they like your software so much

30
00:01:12,099 --> 00:01:15,700
or because it looks nice or is technologically advanced

31
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,999
they do it because it fulfills some neat they have and

32
00:01:19,099 --> 00:01:21,299
that will make the software successful.

33
00:01:21,900 --> 00:01:24,899
Another reason for thinking about needs is you

34
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:27,700
want to compare solutions to each other.

35
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,899
What is the best or cheapest solution for the user

36
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:33,999
or your company that fulfills the needs what

37
00:01:34,099 --> 00:01:37,500
solution is the least effort and risk to develop?

38
00:01:38,500 --> 00:01:41,499
Once you've got the needs you can start discovering the high

39
00:01:41,599 --> 00:01:44,600
level user stories while the product owners

40
00:01:44,700 --> 00:01:46,599
responsible for the outcome.

41
00:01:46,799 --> 00:01:50,100
This is best done involving the whole scrum team a

42
00:01:50,200 --> 00:01:52,199
popular format for documenting.

43
00:01:52,299 --> 00:01:55,500
The results is as a user group.

44
00:01:55,700 --> 00:01:58,800
I want the software to have a certain feature so

45
00:01:58,900 --> 00:02:01,999
that a certain need is fulfilled here

46
00:02:02,099 --> 00:02:04,999
are some examples as a frequent flyer.

47
00:02:05,099 --> 00:02:08,099
I want to book a flight so that I can travel to a

48
00:02:08,300 --> 00:02:11,200
The location or I want to get a discount

49
00:02:11,300 --> 00:02:14,300
if I book often so that I can save money or

50
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:17,399
I want to read book a flight easily so that the booking

51
00:02:17,500 --> 00:02:20,500
process is comfortable as you can see

52
00:02:20,599 --> 00:02:23,700
the end of each of these sentences reflects the needs

53
00:02:23,800 --> 00:02:26,899
we identified earlier and in the middle you see

54
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,000
how the software fulfills this need.

55
00:02:30,199 --> 00:02:33,300
Some properties of good user stories are a

56
00:02:33,400 --> 00:02:36,399
good user story is written from a user's perspective.

57
00:02:36,500 --> 00:02:39,599
Not a technical perspective to make sure you fulfill

58
00:02:39,699 --> 00:02:42,800
the users needs user stories are short

59
00:02:42,900 --> 00:02:45,800
as you've seen in the examples that also means you

60
00:02:45,900 --> 00:02:48,800
leave out the details at first you clarify the

61
00:02:48,900 --> 00:02:52,199
details later shortly before implementing the story

62
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:56,300
stories are more about conversation than documentation.

63
00:02:56,599 --> 00:02:59,900
So you use them to discuss ideas in the scrum team.

64
00:03:00,300 --> 00:03:03,900
And document just enough to avoid for getting the results.

65
00:03:04,300 --> 00:03:07,200
So it shouldn't be the product owner alone who comes up

66
00:03:07,300 --> 00:03:08,300
with these stories.

67
00:03:08,500 --> 00:03:10,900
This is really a whole team effort.
