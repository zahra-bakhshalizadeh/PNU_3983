1
00:00:00,640 --> 00:00:03,120
it's important to make your project

2
00:00:02,399 --> 00:00:06,240
schedule

3
00:00:03,120 --> 00:00:08,720
realistic so tasks occur as close as

4
00:00:06,240 --> 00:00:10,639
possible to the dates you planned

5
00:00:08,720 --> 00:00:12,320
one way to build reality into your

6
00:00:10,639 --> 00:00:15,360
schedule is to estimate

7
00:00:12,320 --> 00:00:15,839
task duration based on the hours people

8
00:00:15,360 --> 00:00:19,119
work

9
00:00:15,839 --> 00:00:19,600
on the project each day people don't

10
00:00:19,119 --> 00:00:21,359
work

11
00:00:19,600 --> 00:00:23,600
a hundred percent of their time on

12
00:00:21,359 --> 00:00:25,840
project tasks people don't even work a

13
00:00:23,600 --> 00:00:28,240
hundred percent of every workday

14
00:00:25,840 --> 00:00:29,039
things like staff meetings paperwork

15
00:00:28,240 --> 00:00:32,320
training

16
00:00:29,039 --> 00:00:35,200
and time off chew up work hours

17
00:00:32,320 --> 00:00:35,920
even walking across campus uses up work

18
00:00:35,200 --> 00:00:38,320
time

19
00:00:35,920 --> 00:00:39,120
so do your best to estimate the number

20
00:00:38,320 --> 00:00:42,079
of hours

21
00:00:39,120 --> 00:00:42,719
people typically work another dose of

22
00:00:42,079 --> 00:00:45,440
reality

23
00:00:42,719 --> 00:00:48,239
is adjusting estimated task hours based

24
00:00:45,440 --> 00:00:50,879
on how fast the assigned workers are

25
00:00:48,239 --> 00:00:52,559
for example if someone is a whiz at

26
00:00:50,879 --> 00:00:53,440
getting computers connected to the

27
00:00:52,559 --> 00:00:56,000
network

28
00:00:53,440 --> 00:00:58,719
you can change the task work hours to

29
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:01,680
reflect her productivity

30
00:00:58,719 --> 00:01:03,920
third to keep people productive assign

31
00:01:01,680 --> 00:01:07,280
resources to work on no more than

32
00:01:03,920 --> 00:01:07,920
three tasks at a time switching between

33
00:01:07,280 --> 00:01:10,799
tasks

34
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:11,119
means a person has to switch focus and

35
00:01:10,799 --> 00:01:15,200
that

36
00:01:11,119 --> 00:01:17,680
introduces a small delay each time

37
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:20,320
when resources are in demand and you

38
00:01:17,680 --> 00:01:22,560
have to assign them to several tasks

39
00:01:20,320 --> 00:01:25,360
adjust those assignments to reflect

40
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:27,520
their decreased productivity

41
00:01:25,360 --> 00:01:28,960
when you make adjustments like these add

42
00:01:27,520 --> 00:01:31,439
a note to your schedule

43
00:01:28,960 --> 00:01:32,320
to document the change and the reason

44
00:01:31,439 --> 00:01:34,560
why

45
00:01:32,320 --> 00:01:37,040
that way you'll know what to do if other

46
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:39,439
changes come up in the future

47
00:01:37,040 --> 00:01:41,200
the closer you model your resource

48
00:01:39,439 --> 00:01:43,439
assignments to reality

49
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:45,439
the easier it will be to keep your

50
00:01:43,439 --> 00:01:48,000
project on time

51
00:01:45,439 --> 00:01:49,360
complete the assignment exercise in the

52
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:55,520
exercise files

53
00:01:49,360 --> 00:01:55,520
to practice assigning resources to tasks
