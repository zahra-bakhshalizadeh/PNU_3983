00:00:00,630 --> 00:00:06,050
Let's examine two common approaches to project
management and how to choose the right one

2
00:00:06,050 --> 00:00:12,701
for your projects when each project management
process group occurs one after another, it's

3
00:00:12,701 --> 00:00:18,400
known as traditional project management or
the waterfall approach because the processes

4
00:00:18,400 --> 00:00:22,230
flow from one to the next.

5
00:00:22,230 --> 00:00:26,749
Waterfall Project Management works well when
the project goal and solution are clearly

6
00:00:26,749 --> 00:00:32,680
defined and the scope and deliverables are
clear cut because you understand what needs

7
00:00:32,680 --> 00:00:38,470
to be done, you step through each process
group once from start to finish.

8
00:00:38,470 --> 00:00:43,210
The more you know about the project, the better
the waterfall approach works.

9
00:00:43,210 --> 00:00:48,440
Simple projects with very little uncertainty
are great candidates because you know what

10
00:00:48,440 --> 00:00:54,210
needs to be done and how to handle issues
that arise with familiar technology.

11
00:00:54,210 --> 00:00:59,570
Your team can be productive because they know
the potential problems and how to work around

12
00:00:59,570 --> 00:01:00,570
them.

13
00:01:00,570 --> 00:01:04,460
If teams have worked on similar projects in
the past, they can be more productive because

14
00:01:04,460 --> 00:01:10,600
they understand the work and know how to prevent
or resolve common problems.

15
00:01:10,600 --> 00:01:15,810
With many projects today, you don't know what
the solution looks like, so you have to figure

16
00:01:15,810 --> 00:01:21,909
it out as you go, this type of project requires
a different approach.

17
00:01:21,909 --> 00:01:28,009
Agile project management goes through iterations
sometimes called sprints, to deliver partial

18
00:01:28,009 --> 00:01:32,770
yet production quality solutions at regular
intervals.

19
00:01:32,770 --> 00:01:37,850
With this approach, the customer gets value
from the project sooner.

20
00:01:37,850 --> 00:01:43,299
In addition, the customer's feedback on what's
been delivered so far can help improve the

21
00:01:43,299 --> 00:01:50,549
overall solution, the customer has to be more
involved than in traditional projects.

22
00:01:50,549 --> 00:01:57,619
Project teams tend to be smaller, more experienced
and able to work without much supervision.

23
00:01:57,619 --> 00:02:01,889
During initiating and planning, you defined
the overall goal for the project and build

24
00:02:01,889 --> 00:02:04,950
a plan to achieve that goal.

25
00:02:04,950 --> 00:02:12,130
With agile project management, you then develop
detailed plans for each iteration.

26
00:02:12,130 --> 00:02:18,140
Executing is easier because you work on one
iteration at a time, and small independent

27
00:02:18,140 --> 00:02:23,810
teams of highly skilled people make it easier
to get the work done.

28
00:02:23,810 --> 00:02:29,830
Another characteristic of agile projects is
that you monitor and control them more closely

29
00:02:29,830 --> 00:02:33,890
and teams tend to communicate faster and more
frequently.

30
00:02:33,890 --> 00:02:42,310
Finally, each iteration has its own closing
process for accepting its specific deliverables.

31
00:02:42,310 --> 00:02:48,240
When the final iteration is accepted, you
can close the entire project.

32
00:02:48,240 --> 00:02:53,650
You'll determine whether the traditional or
agile approach makes sense during project

33
00:02:53,650 --> 00:02:58,360
initiation, once you know whether or not your
solution is clear.
