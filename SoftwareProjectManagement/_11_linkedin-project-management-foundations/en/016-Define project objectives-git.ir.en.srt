1
00:00:00,560 --> 00:00:05,520
once you define the project goal you can

2
00:00:03,120 --> 00:00:07,520
flesh it out by identifying more

3
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:10,160
detailed objectives

4
00:00:07,520 --> 00:00:11,519
they help define the project's scope the

5
00:00:10,160 --> 00:00:13,679
approach you choose

6
00:00:11,519 --> 00:00:14,799
and the success criteria you have to

7
00:00:13,679 --> 00:00:17,039
meet

8
00:00:14,799 --> 00:00:18,800
business objectives support your

9
00:00:17,039 --> 00:00:22,080
organization's goals

10
00:00:18,800 --> 00:00:23,039
for example increase market share to 25

11
00:00:22,080 --> 00:00:26,800
percent

12
00:00:23,039 --> 00:00:30,400
or provide world-class health care

13
00:00:26,800 --> 00:00:33,760
financial objectives are all about money

14
00:00:30,400 --> 00:00:37,200
think increasing revenue by 15 percent

15
00:00:33,760 --> 00:00:38,079
or cutting costs by 10 percent quality

16
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:41,520
objectives

17
00:00:38,079 --> 00:00:43,760
specify how good results need to be

18
00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:46,399
the hospital might want to decrease

19
00:00:43,760 --> 00:00:50,480
staph infections by 80 percent

20
00:00:46,399 --> 00:00:52,719
or decrease readmittance by 75 percent

21
00:00:50,480 --> 00:00:54,160
projects can also have technical

22
00:00:52,719 --> 00:00:55,840
objectives

23
00:00:54,160 --> 00:00:58,079
these are similar to technical

24
00:00:55,840 --> 00:01:00,399
specifications for equipment

25
00:00:58,079 --> 00:01:01,520
the hospital might want mobile equipment

26
00:01:00,399 --> 00:01:04,320
that can be used

27
00:01:01,520 --> 00:01:05,040
in the hospital an ambulance or at a

28
00:01:04,320 --> 00:01:08,240
remote

29
00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:08,960
emergency site there's also a catch-all

30
00:01:08,240 --> 00:01:11,920
category

31
00:01:08,960 --> 00:01:14,479
called performance your project might

32
00:01:11,920 --> 00:01:16,560
need to finish by a specific date

33
00:01:14,479 --> 00:01:19,200
the hospital has to use the government

34
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:21,600
grants before they expire

35
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:23,600
now let's talk about best practices for

36
00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:26,240
documenting objectives

37
00:01:23,600 --> 00:01:27,040
one way to define clear objectives is to

38
00:01:26,240 --> 00:01:30,960
use

39
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:33,920
smart criteria specific objectives

40
00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:36,479
are clear so there's no misunderstanding

41
00:01:33,920 --> 00:01:40,079
about what you're supposed to achieve

42
00:01:36,479 --> 00:01:43,280
for example increase revenue by 15

43
00:01:40,079 --> 00:01:44,000
percent with vague objectives you

44
00:01:43,280 --> 00:01:46,000
probably

45
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:47,680
won't get what the project customer had

46
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:50,079
in mind

47
00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:52,240
measurable objectives make it easy to

48
00:01:50,079 --> 00:01:53,439
see whether or not they have been

49
00:01:52,240 --> 00:01:56,079
achieved

50
00:01:53,439 --> 00:01:58,000
for example the hospital can measure the

51
00:01:56,079 --> 00:02:00,880
decrease in readmittance or

52
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:01,439
revenue increase with qualitative

53
00:02:00,880 --> 00:02:04,880
measures

54
00:02:01,439 --> 00:02:07,200
you might use survey responses such as a

55
00:02:04,880 --> 00:02:09,200
minimum patient satisfaction rating of

56
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:12,319
four and a half stars

57
00:02:09,200 --> 00:02:12,800
achievable or realistic objectives spell

58
00:02:12,319 --> 00:02:15,040
out

59
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:16,640
what you can do with the resources

60
00:02:15,040 --> 00:02:18,959
available

61
00:02:16,640 --> 00:02:19,840
challenging objectives can motivate

62
00:02:18,959 --> 00:02:22,160
people

63
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:25,840
but your team might give up if they

64
00:02:22,160 --> 00:02:28,879
think the objectives are impossible

65
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:32,080
time-related objectives identify when

66
00:02:28,879 --> 00:02:35,519
they need to be achieved be sure to set

67
00:02:32,080 --> 00:02:38,080
a clear target date for example

68
00:02:35,519 --> 00:02:39,360
the government grants must be used by

69
00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:42,720
december 31st

70
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:44,480
2020. now that the project goal and

71
00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:45,920
objectives are identified

72
00:02:44,480 --> 00:02:47,599
you work with the appropriate

73
00:02:45,920 --> 00:02:51,120
stakeholders to perform

74
00:02:47,599 --> 00:02:53,920
a benefit analysis that way

75
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:54,239
you can validate the project aligns with

76
00:02:53,920 --> 00:02:57,280
the

77
00:02:54,239 --> 00:02:59,599
organization's mission and strategy

78
00:02:57,280 --> 00:03:01,280
and delivers the expected value to the

79
00:02:59,599 --> 00:03:03,599
business

80
00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:04,959
project objectives help flesh out the

81
00:03:03,599 --> 00:03:07,920
project goal

82
00:03:04,959 --> 00:03:09,840
and define project scope approach and

83
00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:12,480
success criteria

84
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:13,280
the exercise files include an objectives

85
00:03:12,480 --> 00:03:15,519
template

86
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:17,200
and a description of what the hospital

87
00:03:15,519 --> 00:03:20,480
wants to achieve

88
00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:25,040
use them to list and categorize the

89
00:03:20,480 --> 00:03:25,040
hospital's objectives
