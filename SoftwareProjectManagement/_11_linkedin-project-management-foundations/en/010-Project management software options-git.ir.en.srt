1
00:00:00,640 --> 00:00:05,759
software tools can make your job as a

2
00:00:02,960 --> 00:00:07,919
project manager a little easier

3
00:00:05,759 --> 00:00:09,440
let's talk about types of software and

4
00:00:07,919 --> 00:00:12,960
how you can put it to use

5
00:00:09,440 --> 00:00:16,320
managing projects scheduling software

6
00:00:12,960 --> 00:00:18,560
comes in a variety of shapes and sizes

7
00:00:16,320 --> 00:00:20,800
for most projects you'll want scheduling

8
00:00:18,560 --> 00:00:22,880
software to help you build and manage

9
00:00:20,800 --> 00:00:25,519
your project schedule

10
00:00:22,880 --> 00:00:27,359
there are lots of tools out there such

11
00:00:25,519 --> 00:00:30,160
as microsoft project

12
00:00:27,359 --> 00:00:31,279
oracle primavera liquid planner

13
00:00:30,160 --> 00:00:34,640
smartsheet

14
00:00:31,279 --> 00:00:36,800
reich asana and more

15
00:00:34,640 --> 00:00:38,000
most scheduling tools these days work in

16
00:00:36,800 --> 00:00:41,120
the cloud to make

17
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:41,680
collaboration easier when you think

18
00:00:41,120 --> 00:00:43,520
about

19
00:00:41,680 --> 00:00:44,879
all the project management documents you

20
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:47,760
produce it's

21
00:00:44,879 --> 00:00:49,039
no wonder that a word processing program

22
00:00:47,760 --> 00:00:51,039
is essential

23
00:00:49,039 --> 00:00:53,360
because project documents are laid out

24
00:00:51,039 --> 00:00:56,160
similarly from project to project

25
00:00:53,360 --> 00:00:56,480
you can build document templates that

26
00:00:56,160 --> 00:00:58,399
way

27
00:00:56,480 --> 00:01:00,399
you don't have to start from scratch

28
00:00:58,399 --> 00:01:02,719
every time

29
00:01:00,399 --> 00:01:06,159
a spreadsheet program is another

30
00:01:02,719 --> 00:01:08,159
must-have for calculations and analysis

31
00:01:06,159 --> 00:01:09,920
besides being handy for budgets and

32
00:01:08,159 --> 00:01:12,479
other financial calculations

33
00:01:09,920 --> 00:01:13,439
a spreadsheet can help analyze project

34
00:01:12,479 --> 00:01:15,439
risks

35
00:01:13,439 --> 00:01:17,439
and prioritize which ones you should

36
00:01:15,439 --> 00:01:20,159
keep an eye on

37
00:01:17,439 --> 00:01:21,119
a presentation program like powerpoint

38
00:01:20,159 --> 00:01:23,360
or prezi

39
00:01:21,119 --> 00:01:24,159
is useful for communicating project

40
00:01:23,360 --> 00:01:26,799
information

41
00:01:24,159 --> 00:01:28,880
at a high level or when you want to

42
00:01:26,799 --> 00:01:30,560
include information from other types of

43
00:01:28,880 --> 00:01:32,479
documents

44
00:01:30,560 --> 00:01:34,799
because a team of people work on a

45
00:01:32,479 --> 00:01:36,159
project you need some kind of tool for

46
00:01:34,799 --> 00:01:39,600
collaborating with

47
00:01:36,159 --> 00:01:40,560
others basecamp asana and microsoft

48
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:42,960
sharepoint

49
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:44,000
are a few cloud-based collaboration

50
00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:46,640
tools you can use

51
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:47,439
to share files with others keep track of

52
00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:51,119
issues

53
00:01:47,439 --> 00:01:52,880
or even manage a workflow if you work in

54
00:01:51,119 --> 00:01:56,079
an organization that runs

55
00:01:52,880 --> 00:01:57,119
many large projects at the same time you

56
00:01:56,079 --> 00:02:00,159
should consider

57
00:01:57,119 --> 00:02:02,640
enterprise project management software

58
00:02:00,159 --> 00:02:05,040
enterprise level software provides tools

59
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:06,719
that allow you to find resources with

60
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:08,959
the skills you need

61
00:02:06,719 --> 00:02:10,720
and see which resources are available

62
00:02:08,959 --> 00:02:13,599
when you need them

63
00:02:10,720 --> 00:02:14,800
it helps you track risks issues and

64
00:02:13,599 --> 00:02:17,680
other information

65
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:19,120
and even build document libraries so

66
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:22,400
team members can easily

67
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:24,800
find information they need we've

68
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:26,640
briefly touched on some of the software

69
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:29,120
options available

70
00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:30,480
if you're researching software to use

71
00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:33,519
consider the following

72
00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:36,560
in your decisions your organization's

73
00:02:33,519 --> 00:02:37,599
culture and work environment software

74
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:40,080
budget

75
00:02:37,599 --> 00:02:44,000
the number of projects you manage and

76
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:44,000
their complexity
