1
00:00:00,640 --> 00:00:05,920
with most projects money is important

2
00:00:03,439 --> 00:00:08,400
whether you're trying to make it save it

3
00:00:05,920 --> 00:00:10,639
or stay within a budgeted amount

4
00:00:08,400 --> 00:00:12,480
project cost is one of the three key

5
00:00:10,639 --> 00:00:14,639
constraints you need to manage

6
00:00:12,480 --> 00:00:17,039
and the project budget is your starting

7
00:00:14,639 --> 00:00:19,119
point the project budget should be a

8
00:00:17,039 --> 00:00:20,800
realistic estimate of the cost to

9
00:00:19,119 --> 00:00:23,840
complete the project work

10
00:00:20,800 --> 00:00:26,240
if your estimate is unrealistically high

11
00:00:23,840 --> 00:00:27,840
the project could be cancelled if the

12
00:00:26,240 --> 00:00:30,880
estimate is too low

13
00:00:27,840 --> 00:00:31,359
the project will cost more which usually

14
00:00:30,880 --> 00:00:33,680
means

15
00:00:31,359 --> 00:00:35,280
it won't deliver the financial benefit

16
00:00:33,680 --> 00:00:37,920
it's supposed to

17
00:00:35,280 --> 00:00:39,920
you estimate all the costs associated

18
00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:42,879
with completing the project work

19
00:00:39,920 --> 00:00:43,520
including labor materials and other

20
00:00:42,879 --> 00:00:46,160
costs

21
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:48,320
like travel you can start with rough

22
00:00:46,160 --> 00:00:50,320
estimates for the first few levels of

23
00:00:48,320 --> 00:00:53,120
your work breakdown structure

24
00:00:50,320 --> 00:00:53,440
then create more accurate estimates as

25
00:00:53,120 --> 00:00:57,360
you

26
00:00:53,440 --> 00:00:57,680
learn more about the project labor cost

27
00:00:57,360 --> 00:01:00,800
is

28
00:00:57,680 --> 00:01:03,280
usually a big part of a project's cost

29
00:01:00,800 --> 00:01:04,400
that is what you pay people who work on

30
00:01:03,280 --> 00:01:07,520
the project

31
00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:08,320
if you hire vendors or contractors their

32
00:01:07,520 --> 00:01:11,439
charges go

33
00:01:08,320 --> 00:01:12,320
directly into project labor costs for

34
00:01:11,439 --> 00:01:15,520
employees

35
00:01:12,320 --> 00:01:18,240
you typically use the burdened cost

36
00:01:15,520 --> 00:01:19,360
that includes salary and employee

37
00:01:18,240 --> 00:01:21,600
benefits

38
00:01:19,360 --> 00:01:23,040
you can get burdened rates for roles

39
00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:26,159
from your accounting or

40
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:29,119
hr department projects might use

41
00:01:26,159 --> 00:01:29,600
other types of time-based resources

42
00:01:29,119 --> 00:01:32,560
think

43
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:34,799
equipment or office space that you rent

44
00:01:32,560 --> 00:01:38,640
these costs go into your calculations

45
00:01:34,799 --> 00:01:40,880
too then there's material cost

46
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:41,920
the hospital scheduling project could

47
00:01:40,880 --> 00:01:44,159
include a new

48
00:01:41,920 --> 00:01:46,560
server or training guides and

49
00:01:44,159 --> 00:01:49,439
documentation notebooks

50
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:50,399
finally be sure to include other types

51
00:01:49,439 --> 00:01:52,840
of costs

52
00:01:50,399 --> 00:01:54,000
that don't fit in the previous three

53
00:01:52,840 --> 00:01:57,280
categories

54
00:01:54,000 --> 00:02:00,399
for example travel training expenses

55
00:01:57,280 --> 00:02:02,479
and fees have you ever gotten

56
00:02:00,399 --> 00:02:05,360
into a cash crunch when you didn't have

57
00:02:02,479 --> 00:02:07,920
enough money on hand to pay expenses

58
00:02:05,360 --> 00:02:08,800
projects can run into cash flow problems

59
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:11,599
too

60
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:13,760
which is why you figure out when project

61
00:02:11,599 --> 00:02:15,680
expenses will occur

62
00:02:13,760 --> 00:02:17,840
when you assign resources and other

63
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:18,720
costs to the tasks in your project

64
00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:21,360
schedule

65
00:02:18,720 --> 00:02:23,120
you'll get a rough idea what your cash

66
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:25,520
flow looks like

67
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:26,720
let's say management has money allocated

68
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:29,360
for the project

69
00:02:26,720 --> 00:02:31,840
like the grants and donations earmarked

70
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:34,000
for the hospital scheduling project

71
00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:35,360
if your cost estimate is higher than the

72
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:37,599
allocated amount

73
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:38,959
you have to look at ways to reduce the

74
00:02:37,599 --> 00:02:40,879
project cost

75
00:02:38,959 --> 00:02:42,800
you might eliminate non-essential

76
00:02:40,879 --> 00:02:47,120
expenses or find

77
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:49,280
less expensive resources maybe cut scope

78
00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:50,160
in the hospital scheduling project

79
00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:52,080
management

80
00:02:50,160 --> 00:02:53,680
allocated eight hundred and fifty

81
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:56,640
thousand dollars

82
00:02:53,680 --> 00:02:58,800
the estimate including contingency is

83
00:02:56,640 --> 00:03:00,800
nine hundred and fifty thousand

84
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:02,560
you might consider working with less

85
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:05,680
contingency funds

86
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:08,800
ask for more money or dive in to find

87
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:11,680
ways to cut the total cost

88
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:12,800
the project budget is the cost target

89
00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:16,000
you aim for

90
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:18,159
as you manage a project for practice

91
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:19,840
think about what you can do about the

92
00:03:18,159 --> 00:03:22,239
hundred thousand dollars

93
00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:27,599
that exceeds the amount that management

94
00:03:22,239 --> 00:03:27,599
has allocated for the scheduling project
