1
00:00:00,799 --> 00:00:03,439
before we talk about how to manage

2
00:00:02,560 --> 00:00:05,120
projects

3
00:00:03,439 --> 00:00:07,839
let's make sure we're all on the same

4
00:00:05,120 --> 00:00:11,200
page about what a project is

5
00:00:07,839 --> 00:00:12,960
here's a formal definition a project is

6
00:00:11,200 --> 00:00:15,599
a temporary endeavor

7
00:00:12,960 --> 00:00:16,960
that has a unique goal and usually a

8
00:00:15,599 --> 00:00:19,520
budget

9
00:00:16,960 --> 00:00:20,960
that's a start but what does it really

10
00:00:19,520 --> 00:00:24,320
mean

11
00:00:20,960 --> 00:00:26,960
let's begin with temporary endeavor

12
00:00:24,320 --> 00:00:28,000
unlike day-to-day operations a project

13
00:00:26,960 --> 00:00:30,960
has a definite

14
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:32,559
beginning and end if a project is

15
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:34,160
implementing a new system

16
00:00:32,559 --> 00:00:37,680
the project is done when you

17
00:00:34,160 --> 00:00:41,600
successfully hand it over to operations

18
00:00:37,680 --> 00:00:43,760
what if a project seems to go on forever

19
00:00:41,600 --> 00:00:46,559
it could be that you haven't clearly

20
00:00:43,760 --> 00:00:49,760
defined what you're trying to accomplish

21
00:00:46,559 --> 00:00:52,960
that brings us to the project goal

22
00:00:49,760 --> 00:00:53,520
a project produces a unique result which

23
00:00:52,960 --> 00:00:56,960
could be

24
00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:58,640
a product service or other outcome

25
00:00:56,960 --> 00:01:00,480
in the case study we're using for this

26
00:00:58,640 --> 00:01:03,440
course the hospital is

27
00:01:00,480 --> 00:01:04,879
implementing a new scheduling system

28
00:01:03,440 --> 00:01:07,520
lots of organizations

29
00:01:04,879 --> 00:01:08,000
implement scheduling systems but each

30
00:01:07,520 --> 00:01:10,159
one

31
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:12,400
has its own set of objectives

32
00:01:10,159 --> 00:01:14,479
constraints and issues

33
00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:15,840
maybe the hospital struggles with staff

34
00:01:14,479 --> 00:01:17,920
shortages

35
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:19,439
or perhaps a big pain point is

36
00:01:17,920 --> 00:01:21,680
scheduling equipment

37
00:01:19,439 --> 00:01:23,840
along with the skilled staff and rooms

38
00:01:21,680 --> 00:01:25,759
needed to operate it

39
00:01:23,840 --> 00:01:27,600
you could be upgrading the scheduling

40
00:01:25,759 --> 00:01:31,439
system to improve results

41
00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:31,840
and level of care finally most projects

42
00:01:31,439 --> 00:01:35,119
have

43
00:01:31,840 --> 00:01:37,040
budgets most of the time you think money

44
00:01:35,119 --> 00:01:39,439
when you hear the word budget

45
00:01:37,040 --> 00:01:40,880
in projects you'll probably face other

46
00:01:39,439 --> 00:01:44,079
constraints as well

47
00:01:40,880 --> 00:01:44,880
like how many resources are available a

48
00:01:44,079 --> 00:01:47,520
project

49
00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:48,560
isn't the same as operations which

50
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:51,680
represents work

51
00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:53,280
that's the same day after day producing

52
00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:55,360
the same results

53
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:56,320
admitting patients into the hospital

54
00:01:55,360 --> 00:01:59,600
represents

55
00:01:56,320 --> 00:02:01,360
operational work patients may show up

56
00:01:59,600 --> 00:02:03,520
with different medical issues

57
00:02:01,360 --> 00:02:05,200
but the people at the front desk follow

58
00:02:03,520 --> 00:02:08,479
the same procedures

59
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:10,720
and use the same forms to admit them

60
00:02:08,479 --> 00:02:11,520
introducing a new scheduling system into

61
00:02:10,720 --> 00:02:15,360
the hospital

62
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:18,400
on the other hand is a project

63
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:20,400
it will have a specific beginning

64
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:23,760
it ends when the system is up and

65
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:26,400
running scheduling hospital resources

66
00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:28,800
it has a unique goal to solve the

67
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:31,920
hospital scheduling issues

68
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:35,680
and it has a budget both in money and

69
00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:37,760
resources time over your lifetime

70
00:02:35,680 --> 00:02:39,360
you've probably worked on lots of

71
00:02:37,760 --> 00:02:42,640
projects both at work

72
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:43,519
and at home a project is a temporary

73
00:02:42,640 --> 00:02:47,280
endeavor

74
00:02:43,519 --> 00:02:49,840
with a unique goal and usually a budget

75
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:52,160
using those characteristics think about

76
00:02:49,840 --> 00:02:53,440
what you've done over the past several

77
00:02:52,160 --> 00:02:55,360
months

78
00:02:53,440 --> 00:02:56,480
identify the projects you've worked on

79
00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:59,440
during that time

80
00:02:56,480 --> 00:03:01,440
by identifying the project's time frame

81
00:02:59,440 --> 00:03:04,720
what made the project unique

82
00:03:01,440 --> 00:03:06,480
and its budget in the exercise files

83
00:03:04,720 --> 00:03:09,200
you'll find a list of the work

84
00:03:06,480 --> 00:03:10,080
i've done recently tagged either as

85
00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:13,680
projects

86
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:13,680
or operations
