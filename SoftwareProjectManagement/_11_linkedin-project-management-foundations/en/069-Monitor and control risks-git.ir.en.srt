1
00:00:00,640 --> 00:00:04,240
your risk management plan includes the

2
00:00:02,960 --> 00:00:06,240
risks you monitor

3
00:00:04,240 --> 00:00:08,800
and the response you would use to handle

4
00:00:06,240 --> 00:00:10,719
them now the project is underway

5
00:00:08,800 --> 00:00:13,120
you need to keep your eyes peeled for

6
00:00:10,719 --> 00:00:15,839
those risks becoming reality

7
00:00:13,120 --> 00:00:18,080
and if they do you jump into action with

8
00:00:15,839 --> 00:00:20,720
the appropriate response

9
00:00:18,080 --> 00:00:22,320
in the risk management plan each risk

10
00:00:20,720 --> 00:00:25,119
you decided to monitor

11
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:27,119
has an owner assigned that person's job

12
00:00:25,119 --> 00:00:30,400
is to watch their assigned risk

13
00:00:27,119 --> 00:00:32,480
and regularly update its status

14
00:00:30,400 --> 00:00:34,880
let's take a look at what owning a risk

15
00:00:32,480 --> 00:00:37,840
means in detail

16
00:00:34,880 --> 00:00:38,399
before a risk occurs you proactively

17
00:00:37,840 --> 00:00:41,680
implement

18
00:00:38,399 --> 00:00:42,640
risk responses that means you take steps

19
00:00:41,680 --> 00:00:45,200
to avoid

20
00:00:42,640 --> 00:00:46,559
mitigate or plan contingencies for the

21
00:00:45,200 --> 00:00:48,640
risk

22
00:00:46,559 --> 00:00:49,760
then you watch for signs that high

23
00:00:48,640 --> 00:00:53,360
priority risks

24
00:00:49,760 --> 00:00:54,320
are unfolding also watch for the events

25
00:00:53,360 --> 00:00:57,760
that trigger

26
00:00:54,320 --> 00:01:00,719
a contingency plan when a risk occurs

27
00:00:57,760 --> 00:01:02,800
launch the response you planned then

28
00:01:00,719 --> 00:01:06,320
track the results

29
00:01:02,800 --> 00:01:10,080
finally regularly report risk status

30
00:01:06,320 --> 00:01:12,720
and update the risk log and detail sheet

31
00:01:10,080 --> 00:01:16,000
upgrade or downgrade risk probability or

32
00:01:12,720 --> 00:01:18,720
impact if situations have changed

33
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:19,600
sometimes risks go away as the project

34
00:01:18,720 --> 00:01:22,880
progresses

35
00:01:19,600 --> 00:01:26,640
and you can close them

36
00:01:22,880 --> 00:01:28,479
don't forget about lower priority risks

37
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:29,840
changes in the project could bump up

38
00:01:28,479 --> 00:01:32,720
their probability or

39
00:01:29,840 --> 00:01:34,880
impact as a team check on them

40
00:01:32,720 --> 00:01:36,240
occasionally to see if they should be

41
00:01:34,880 --> 00:01:39,360
tracked

42
00:01:36,240 --> 00:01:41,360
also watch for possible new risks that

43
00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:44,479
have arisen due to changes

44
00:01:41,360 --> 00:01:45,280
to the project managing and controlling

45
00:01:44,479 --> 00:01:48,560
risks is

46
00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:51,200
fairly easy as long as you have a plan

47
00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:51,759
the exercise files include a scenario in

48
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:55,040
which of

49
00:01:51,759 --> 00:01:56,640
risk comes to fruition for practice

50
00:01:55,040 --> 00:02:01,200
think about what you would do in

51
00:01:56,640 --> 00:02:01,200
response and why
