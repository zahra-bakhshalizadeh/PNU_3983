1
00:00:00,640 --> 00:00:03,120
if you've ever heard abbot and

2
00:00:02,320 --> 00:00:05,920
costello's

3
00:00:03,120 --> 00:00:07,839
who's on first skit you know how hard it

4
00:00:05,920 --> 00:00:11,200
can be to get your point across

5
00:00:07,839 --> 00:00:14,240
the success of a project depends on good

6
00:00:11,200 --> 00:00:15,280
communication that's why you set up a

7
00:00:14,240 --> 00:00:18,320
communication

8
00:00:15,280 --> 00:00:21,439
plan the right people getting the right

9
00:00:18,320 --> 00:00:24,800
information at the right time and

10
00:00:21,439 --> 00:00:26,000
in the right way you start with your

11
00:00:24,800 --> 00:00:28,560
audiences

12
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:30,080
who needs to know about the project the

13
00:00:28,560 --> 00:00:32,320
responsibility matrix

14
00:00:30,080 --> 00:00:34,000
is a good place to look to find your

15
00:00:32,320 --> 00:00:37,200
audiences

16
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:40,800
second what do your audiences need

17
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:42,160
or want to know management stakeholders

18
00:00:40,800 --> 00:00:45,280
care about a project

19
00:00:42,160 --> 00:00:47,280
achieving its objectives early on you

20
00:00:45,280 --> 00:00:47,760
give them the project plans so they can

21
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:50,559
see

22
00:00:47,760 --> 00:00:52,079
how you're going to deliver later on

23
00:00:50,559 --> 00:00:54,800
they want to know about

24
00:00:52,079 --> 00:00:57,280
progress how much you've spent and the

25
00:00:54,800 --> 00:01:00,160
overall project results

26
00:00:57,280 --> 00:01:01,600
the project sponsor is tightly connected

27
00:01:00,160 --> 00:01:03,600
with the project

28
00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:05,680
you'll probably communicate with the

29
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:08,640
sponsor more often

30
00:01:05,680 --> 00:01:09,840
maybe in face-to-face meetings

31
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:12,159
functional managers

32
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:13,040
initially need to know the skill sets

33
00:01:12,159 --> 00:01:15,680
you need

34
00:01:13,040 --> 00:01:16,080
when you need them and other things like

35
00:01:15,680 --> 00:01:18,240
cost

36
00:01:16,080 --> 00:01:19,119
constraints once people are on

37
00:01:18,240 --> 00:01:21,600
assignment

38
00:01:19,119 --> 00:01:24,000
these managers want to know when their

39
00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:25,840
people will be done

40
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:27,600
team members need to know what they're

41
00:01:25,840 --> 00:01:29,520
supposed to do

42
00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:31,040
they're more likely to buy into the

43
00:01:29,520 --> 00:01:34,240
project if you tell them

44
00:01:31,040 --> 00:01:36,640
how their work fits into the big picture

45
00:01:34,240 --> 00:01:39,040
as time passes they also need to know

46
00:01:36,640 --> 00:01:41,520
what's coming up next

47
00:01:39,040 --> 00:01:42,799
the last part of a communication plan is

48
00:01:41,520 --> 00:01:46,000
the how

49
00:01:42,799 --> 00:01:46,880
how often the methods you use and the

50
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:49,280
format

51
00:01:46,880 --> 00:01:50,320
face-to-face communication is good for

52
00:01:49,280 --> 00:01:52,560
brainstorming

53
00:01:50,320 --> 00:01:54,399
getting to know people and discussing

54
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:57,200
sensitive topics

55
00:01:54,399 --> 00:01:57,840
if your team is dispersed geographically

56
00:01:57,200 --> 00:02:00,079
email

57
00:01:57,840 --> 00:02:02,240
conference calls and video conferencing

58
00:02:00,079 --> 00:02:04,880
are indispensable

59
00:02:02,240 --> 00:02:05,600
you know that stakeholder management is

60
00:02:04,880 --> 00:02:08,160
all about

61
00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:09,759
getting and keeping stakeholders support

62
00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:12,480
for your project

63
00:02:09,759 --> 00:02:13,120
the communication plan helps by spelling

64
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:14,800
out

65
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:17,200
how you're going to communicate with

66
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:20,560
stakeholders to keep them on board

67
00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:21,360
and happy a communication plan helps

68
00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:24,000
ensure that

69
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:24,720
people get the information they need in

70
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:27,040
the most

71
00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:28,080
effective way to solidify your

72
00:02:27,040 --> 00:02:30,160
understanding

73
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:34,800
set up a communication plan for the

74
00:02:30,160 --> 00:02:34,800
hospital scheduling project
