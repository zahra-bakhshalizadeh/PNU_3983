Most people see project managers as really
organized and good at getting things done,

2
00:00:07,650 --> 00:00:13,500
but project managers also use a wide variety
of skills and knowledge to complete projects

3
00:00:13,500 --> 00:00:20,060
successfully. First, there are technical skills
specific to project management, like what

4
00:00:20,060 --> 00:00:25,300
goes into a project plan building and fine
tuning a project schedule, reading a Gantt

5
00:00:25,300 --> 00:00:33,300
chart using the critical path and measuring
performance. Then there's business expertise.

6
00:00:33,300 --> 00:00:39,940
It's up to you to make sure your project delivers
value. You need to understand your organization's

7
00:00:39,940 --> 00:00:46,210
business, what it does and what it considers
important. That way, you can see how your

8
00:00:46,210 --> 00:00:53,720
project fits in and you can make good decisions
to ensure that your project is successful,

9
00:00:53,720 --> 00:01:00,699
Problem-Solving is another important skill
projects never and I mean never go according

10
00:01:00,699 --> 00:01:07,490
to plan. Your job is to figure out how to
achieve project objectives and meet the schedule

11
00:01:07,490 --> 00:01:13,110
and budget while working around the problems
that arise. One of the most important things

12
00:01:13,110 --> 00:01:19,220
in a project managers toolbox is interpersonal
skills. Projects may use people from different

13
00:01:19,220 --> 00:01:25,861
groups, departments and even different companies.
You're the leader of this group, so it's your

14
00:01:25,861 --> 00:01:32,759
job to help everyone work as a team to get
the project done and done. Well, the most

15
00:01:32,759 --> 00:01:38,390
important characteristic of a great project
manager is strong leadership. You want to

16
00:01:38,390 --> 00:01:45,370
inspire your people, help them become a true
team, guide them to do the right things, hold

17
00:01:45,370 --> 00:01:50,950
them accountable and motivate them to give
their best to project management. Sound like

18
00:01:50,950 --> 00:01:56,100
something you want to do? This course will
help you figure out what you need to know

19
00:01:56,100 --> 00:01:59,659
so you can build a plan for developing your
skills.
