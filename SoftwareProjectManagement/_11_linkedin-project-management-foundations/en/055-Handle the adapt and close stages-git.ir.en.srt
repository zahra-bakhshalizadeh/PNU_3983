1
00:00:00,640 --> 00:00:04,319
you've made it to the last stage of an

2
00:00:03,120 --> 00:00:08,960
iteration

3
00:00:04,319 --> 00:00:11,599
the adapt stage it's a time for review

4
00:00:08,960 --> 00:00:12,240
and reflection like spending new year's

5
00:00:11,599 --> 00:00:14,480
day

6
00:00:12,240 --> 00:00:15,679
evaluating your previous year and

7
00:00:14,480 --> 00:00:18,160
resolving to do

8
00:00:15,679 --> 00:00:18,800
even better in the next as you might

9
00:00:18,160 --> 00:00:20,640
expect

10
00:00:18,800 --> 00:00:22,960
you and the team compare what was

11
00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:25,599
delivered to what was planned

12
00:00:22,960 --> 00:00:28,240
you talk about what did and didn't work

13
00:00:25,599 --> 00:00:31,359
the team might identify changes to make

14
00:00:28,240 --> 00:00:33,040
future iterations run better take time

15
00:00:31,359 --> 00:00:35,360
to review with the customer

16
00:00:33,040 --> 00:00:36,160
what's been done and make sure that the

17
00:00:35,360 --> 00:00:38,559
features are

18
00:00:36,160 --> 00:00:39,520
working the way they should at the same

19
00:00:38,559 --> 00:00:41,600
time check

20
00:00:39,520 --> 00:00:44,160
that the features produce the business

21
00:00:41,600 --> 00:00:46,399
benefits they're supposed to

22
00:00:44,160 --> 00:00:47,360
don't forget to hold a lessons learn

23
00:00:46,399 --> 00:00:49,520
session to share

24
00:00:47,360 --> 00:00:51,840
feedback that way everyone can

25
00:00:49,520 --> 00:00:52,480
brainstorm ways to resolve issues and

26
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:55,760
eliminate

27
00:00:52,480 --> 00:00:57,840
obstacles plus everyone can improve by

28
00:00:55,760 --> 00:00:59,199
taking advantage of the things that went

29
00:00:57,840 --> 00:01:02,000
well

30
00:00:59,199 --> 00:01:02,719
feedback can lead to changes in the next

31
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:06,240
iteration

32
00:01:02,719 --> 00:01:08,560
speculate stage you might add or remove

33
00:01:06,240 --> 00:01:10,720
features from the backlog the team could

34
00:01:08,560 --> 00:01:14,159
modify their estimates for features

35
00:01:10,720 --> 00:01:14,640
or update the risk register the customer

36
00:01:14,159 --> 00:01:16,320
might

37
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:19,040
re-prioritize the features in the

38
00:01:16,320 --> 00:01:19,840
backlog maybe the team composition needs

39
00:01:19,040 --> 00:01:21,680
tweaking

40
00:01:19,840 --> 00:01:23,200
based on people's availability or the

41
00:01:21,680 --> 00:01:26,080
skills needed

42
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:28,080
finally you might modify processes that

43
00:01:26,080 --> 00:01:30,880
aren't working well

44
00:01:28,080 --> 00:01:31,200
the end of an iteration is a great time

45
00:01:30,880 --> 00:01:34,640
to

46
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:36,720
celebrate success in addition the adapt

47
00:01:34,640 --> 00:01:38,000
stage is a chance for team members to

48
00:01:36,720 --> 00:01:40,479
take a quick break

49
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:41,600
so they're fresh and enthusiastic about

50
00:01:40,479 --> 00:01:44,240
starting the next

51
00:01:41,600 --> 00:01:45,280
iteration if there are more iterations

52
00:01:44,240 --> 00:01:48,000
in the project

53
00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:50,000
the end of the adapt stage triggers the

54
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:52,799
speculate stage for the next

55
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:54,000
iteration on the other hand if the

56
00:01:52,799 --> 00:01:56,640
project schedule or

57
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:57,439
budget has been used up it's time for

58
00:01:56,640 --> 00:02:00,799
the close

59
00:01:57,439 --> 00:02:03,680
phase and tying up loose ends

60
00:02:00,799 --> 00:02:05,600
you reconcile the project financials

61
00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:07,759
have all the invoices been paid

62
00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:10,399
have you closed the project accounts so

63
00:02:07,759 --> 00:02:12,560
people don't charge to them by mistake

64
00:02:10,399 --> 00:02:14,000
you also need to work with resource

65
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:17,040
managers to reassign

66
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:19,280
team members as in any project you

67
00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:22,720
communicate the project results to the

68
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:23,760
customer and stakeholders it's important

69
00:02:22,720 --> 00:02:26,720
to get closure

70
00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:28,239
at the end of each iteration and the end

71
00:02:26,720 --> 00:02:31,519
of the project

72
00:02:28,239 --> 00:02:34,640
that way you confirm the success of this

73
00:02:31,519 --> 00:02:36,800
and future projects for practice

74
00:02:34,640 --> 00:02:38,000
build agendas for the review meetings

75
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:43,599
you plan to hold

76
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:43,599
during an iterations adapt stage
