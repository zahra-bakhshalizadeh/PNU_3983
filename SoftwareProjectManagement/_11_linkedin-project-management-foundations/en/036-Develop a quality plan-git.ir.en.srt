1
00:00:00,799 --> 00:00:07,200
project success actually means

2
00:00:03,520 --> 00:00:09,840
meeting objectives not exceeding them

3
00:00:07,200 --> 00:00:11,360
quality management includes processes to

4
00:00:09,840 --> 00:00:13,360
make sure that a project

5
00:00:11,360 --> 00:00:14,719
satisfies its objectives and

6
00:00:13,360 --> 00:00:17,279
requirements

7
00:00:14,719 --> 00:00:18,000
a quality management plan is your

8
00:00:17,279 --> 00:00:21,439
roadmap

9
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:23,519
to meeting objectives project quality

10
00:00:21,439 --> 00:00:24,480
translates into meeting the customers

11
00:00:23,519 --> 00:00:28,080
requirements

12
00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:30,800
and delivering on time and within budget

13
00:00:28,080 --> 00:00:34,640
with deliverables and products quality

14
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:37,360
also means conforming to specifications

15
00:00:34,640 --> 00:00:38,960
a quality management plan has three

16
00:00:37,360 --> 00:00:41,600
components

17
00:00:38,960 --> 00:00:43,200
first there's the quality standards for

18
00:00:41,600 --> 00:00:45,920
deliverables

19
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:47,680
for a product the quality standard might

20
00:00:45,920 --> 00:00:50,079
include the acceptable

21
00:00:47,680 --> 00:00:51,360
tolerance for its dimensions or the

22
00:00:50,079 --> 00:00:54,079
acceptable number of

23
00:00:51,360 --> 00:00:56,000
defective widgets in a batch for the

24
00:00:54,079 --> 00:00:58,079
hospital scheduling project

25
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:59,359
one quality standard might be that the

26
00:00:58,079 --> 00:01:01,680
scheduling system

27
00:00:59,359 --> 00:01:03,280
meets all the required scheduling

28
00:01:01,680 --> 00:01:06,080
functions

29
00:01:03,280 --> 00:01:08,400
keep in mind that the goal is to meet

30
00:01:06,080 --> 00:01:10,960
the quality standards

31
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:12,400
obviously you don't want quality that's

32
00:01:10,960 --> 00:01:15,520
below standard

33
00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:18,000
the customer won't be happy they might

34
00:01:15,520 --> 00:01:21,439
ask for additional work to get it right

35
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:24,080
or simply refuse to pay

36
00:01:21,439 --> 00:01:25,119
this might surprise you you don't want

37
00:01:24,080 --> 00:01:28,560
quality that's

38
00:01:25,119 --> 00:01:30,560
higher than required why because other

39
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:34,159
aspects of the project can suffer

40
00:01:30,560 --> 00:01:35,680
like a later finish date or higher cost

41
00:01:34,159 --> 00:01:37,200
the second part of the quality

42
00:01:35,680 --> 00:01:40,320
management plan is a

43
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:41,920
quality assurance plan this spells out

44
00:01:40,320 --> 00:01:44,320
the processes you use

45
00:01:41,920 --> 00:01:45,439
during the project to ensure that the

46
00:01:44,320 --> 00:01:47,680
final results

47
00:01:45,439 --> 00:01:49,200
meet the quality standards for the

48
00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:51,920
scheduling system

49
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:53,600
reviewing requirements and designs falls

50
00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:56,240
into this category

51
00:01:53,600 --> 00:01:58,079
you might also test software functions

52
00:01:56,240 --> 00:02:01,680
as they're developed

53
00:01:58,079 --> 00:02:04,560
finally you plan for quality control

54
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:07,520
which means how you measure and monitor

55
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:10,160
quality in the final deliverables

56
00:02:07,520 --> 00:02:12,080
the bottom line is that you examine or

57
00:02:10,160 --> 00:02:14,800
measure results to see if they

58
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:15,599
meet the standard set for the scheduling

59
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:18,080
project

60
00:02:15,599 --> 00:02:19,760
the final acceptance test would measure

61
00:02:18,080 --> 00:02:22,879
whether the processes and

62
00:02:19,760 --> 00:02:24,640
system achieve their objectives for the

63
00:02:22,879 --> 00:02:27,040
hospital's new cancer wing

64
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:29,200
you would do a walk through to confirm

65
00:02:27,040 --> 00:02:30,879
that the construction has been completed

66
00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:34,480
correctly

67
00:02:30,879 --> 00:02:37,760
continuous improvement is a big part of

68
00:02:34,480 --> 00:02:38,560
quality management if you find quality

69
00:02:37,760 --> 00:02:40,879
issues

70
00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:41,840
you analyze the problems to see how to

71
00:02:40,879 --> 00:02:45,200
prevent them

72
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:46,720
or at least reduce their frequency cause

73
00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:49,440
and effect diagrams

74
00:02:46,720 --> 00:02:50,080
are also called fishbone diagrams

75
00:02:49,440 --> 00:02:52,879
because they

76
00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:54,879
look like a fish skeleton they help

77
00:02:52,879 --> 00:02:55,920
identify factors that could lead to

78
00:02:54,879 --> 00:02:58,080
problems

79
00:02:55,920 --> 00:03:00,800
those factors can help you figure out

80
00:02:58,080 --> 00:03:03,920
ways to prevent the problems

81
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:04,560
another tool is a pareto diagram this

82
00:03:03,920 --> 00:03:07,200
shows

83
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:08,319
how many defects are generated by each

84
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:10,720
cause

85
00:03:08,319 --> 00:03:12,560
that way you can address the causes that

86
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:15,840
produce the most defects

87
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:16,640
first by developing a quality management

88
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:18,800
plan

89
00:03:16,640 --> 00:03:20,640
you can ensure that your project meets

90
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:23,519
its quality objectives

91
00:03:20,640 --> 00:03:24,959
for practice identify potential quality

92
00:03:23,519 --> 00:03:27,840
assurance processes

93
00:03:24,959 --> 00:03:29,239
and quality control measures for each of

94
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:32,239
the project

95
00:03:29,239 --> 00:03:32,239
objectives
