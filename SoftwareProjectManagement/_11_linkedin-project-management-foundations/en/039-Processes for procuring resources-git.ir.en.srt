00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:06,140

For initiating and planning, you might work with
a small core team before you begin



2
2
00:00:06,140 --> 00:00:11,750

executing project work, you bring on the rest
of the team and acquire needed equipment



3
3
00:00:11,750 --> 00:00:17,960

and materials. If team members come from
within your organization, procurement might be

4


4
00:00:17,960 --> 00:00:22,760

as simple as telling your in-house team
it's time to start your assignments.

5


5
00:00:23,710 --> 00:00:29,290

For resources outside your organization, the procurement
process has a few more steps

6


6
00:00:29,920 --> 00:00:36,940

solicitation, evaluation, selection, contracting
and ongoing management.



7
7
00:00:37,900 --> 00:00:43,630

These steps can take time, so be sure to
leave room in your schedule for performing them.

8


8
00:00:44,530 --> 00:00:50,790

Solicitation often begins with a request
for proposal abbreviated as RFP.

9

9
00:00:51,340 --> 00:00:55,180

It's a typical way to ask
vendors for proposals or bids.

10


10
00:00:56,050 --> 00:01:01,420

An RFP describes the services or resources
you need when you need them.

11


11
00:01:01,420 --> 00:01:07,840

And your budget for the work include the criteria
you plan to use to select a vendor so

12


12
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:10,630

companies can decide whether or not to bid.

13


13
00:01:11,550 --> 00:01:17,520

Don't forget to include instructions and the
deadline for submitting a proposal and the



14
14
00:01:17,520 --> 00:01:19,470

date you'll announce your decision.



15
15
00:01:20,970 --> 00:01:26,610

Once you have all the vendors, proposals or
bids, you hunker down and evaluate the



16
16
00:01:26,610 --> 00:01:32,310

responses using your criteria, how you select
the winner depends on the size and



17
17
00:01:32,310 --> 00:01:33,870

complexity of the project.

18


18
00:01:34,620 --> 00:01:41,010

Evaluation and selection might be as easy as
filling in a spreadsheet with ratings and



19
19
00:01:41,010 --> 00:01:43,070

choosing the vendor with the highest score.

20


20
00:01:44,040 --> 00:01:50,010

For large jobs, you might whittle the submissions down
to a short list of vendors and ask



21
21
00:01:50,010 --> 00:01:56,520

each one in the second round to prepare
a more detailed presentation or demonstrate what

22


22
00:01:56,550 --> 00:01:57,630

they have to offer.

23


23
00:01:58,490 --> 00:02:03,920

For example, in the scheduling system project, you
might ask the top two candidates to

24


24
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:09,500

demonstrate their systems and show
how features satisfy project requirements.


25

25
00:02:10,040 --> 00:02:15,650

Contracting is when you prepare and sign
a contract for the resources you need.



26
26
00:02:16,670 --> 00:02:22,850

Contracts usually include a statement of
work terms and conditions, deliverables,

27


27
00:02:22,850 --> 00:02:25,670

deadlines and, of course, the price.

28


28
00:02:27,290 --> 00:02:34,040

Contracts fall into several categories, fixed price
contracts work when your project is

29


29
00:02:34,040 --> 00:02:40,100

well defined, this type of contract places the
risk on the vendor because the vendor is



30
30
00:02:40,100 --> 00:02:45,590

paid a fixed amount, no matter how much time
the work takes or how much it costs.



31
31
00:02:46,250 --> 00:02:50,720

Time and materials contracts pay for
time worked and expenses incurred.

32


32
00:02:51,260 --> 00:02:53,840

The project accepts most of the risk.



33
33
00:02:53,870 --> 00:02:59,280

So it's common to include and not
to exceed value to limit the price.

34


34
00:02:59,870 --> 00:03:06,440

A cost plus contract is like time and
materials with the addition of penalties or rewards

35


35
00:03:06,770 --> 00:03:08,420

based on the vendors performance.



36
36
00:03:09,140 --> 00:03:15,470

With a retainer, you agree to pay for a
specified amount of time and define the work as

37


37
00:03:15,470 --> 00:03:22,570

you go. Complete procurement steps early enough,
so the resources you need are available

38
00:

38
03:22,570 --> 00:03:23,930

when work begins.

39


39
00:03:24,370 --> 00:03:30,460

For example, if your project requires materials
with long lead times, you'll need to



40
40
00:03:30,460 --> 00:03:32,080

start procurement early.

41


41
00:03:32,650 --> 00:03:39,190

After you award contracts, you don't sit back
and relax while project work is underway.



42
42
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:46,030

You manage those contracts, monitor the vendor
performance and manage any changes for


43

43
00:03:46,030 --> 00:03:52,24
0
practice. Think about which type of contract you
would use for the scheduling system and



44
44
00:03:52,240 --> 00:03:52,660

why.
