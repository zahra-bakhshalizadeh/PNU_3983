1
00:00:00,560 --> 00:00:03,600
once the stakeholders have approved the

2
00:00:02,560 --> 00:00:06,000
project plan

3
00:00:03,600 --> 00:00:07,359
it's time to define your project

4
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:09,679
baseline

5
00:00:07,359 --> 00:00:11,440
the baseline is a collection of the

6
00:00:09,679 --> 00:00:14,639
approved project documents

7
00:00:11,440 --> 00:00:17,440
like requirements the schedule budget

8
00:00:14,639 --> 00:00:19,439
spreadsheets and more basically

9
00:00:17,440 --> 00:00:22,640
everything you want to control

10
00:00:19,439 --> 00:00:23,920
with change management process with

11
00:00:22,640 --> 00:00:25,920
baseline documents

12
00:00:23,920 --> 00:00:27,519
you can compare actual project

13
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:29,920
performance to the baseline

14
00:00:27,519 --> 00:00:31,920
to see how the project's doing because

15
00:00:29,920 --> 00:00:33,600
the baseline is controlled by the change

16
00:00:31,920 --> 00:00:36,000
management process

17
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:36,880
any changes to baseline documents show

18
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:39,760
up as

19
00:00:36,880 --> 00:00:40,480
change requests how you define the

20
00:00:39,760 --> 00:00:43,760
baseline

21
00:00:40,480 --> 00:00:46,079
depends on what you're defining first

22
00:00:43,760 --> 00:00:47,120
save the baseline version of plan

23
00:00:46,079 --> 00:00:49,200
documents

24
00:00:47,120 --> 00:00:51,120
if something changes you flag those

25
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:54,000
changes in a revision of the

26
00:00:51,120 --> 00:00:56,239
corresponding baseline document

27
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:57,360
next baseline the values in your project

28
00:00:56,239 --> 00:00:59,280
schedule

29
00:00:57,360 --> 00:01:01,920
project scheduling programs typically

30
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:04,159
provide a feature for saving a baseline

31
00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:06,240
the baseline includes the approved

32
00:01:04,159 --> 00:01:10,080
values for start and finish dates

33
00:01:06,240 --> 00:01:12,400
task duration work cost and so on

34
00:01:10,080 --> 00:01:13,360
as you record progress or make changes

35
00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:16,320
to the schedule

36
00:01:13,360 --> 00:01:18,000
the program will show any variances from

37
00:01:16,320 --> 00:01:20,400
the baseline

38
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:22,880
once you document the project baseline

39
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:26,159
you're ready to use it to evaluate

40
00:01:22,880 --> 00:01:27,119
progress and project performance for

41
00:01:26,159 --> 00:01:29,600
practice

42
00:01:27,119 --> 00:01:31,680
what documents would you include in the

43
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:33,439
scheduling project baseline

44
00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:34,960
and where might you store these

45
00:01:33,439 --> 00:01:39,040
documents to make them

46
00:01:34,960 --> 00:01:39,040
easy to access
