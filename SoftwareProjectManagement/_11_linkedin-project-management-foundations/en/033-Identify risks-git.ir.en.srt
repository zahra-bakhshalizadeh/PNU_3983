00:00:00,680 --> 00:00:06,410

You've already put a lot of planning into your
project, the next step is to plan for what

2

2
00:00:06,410 --> 00:00:12,530

could go wrong because, you know, something
will instead of asking for an adrenaline



4
3
00:00:12,530 --> 00:00:18,470

rush, why not identify what could go wrong so
you can plan ahead for dealing with issues?


5
4
00:00:19,420 --> 00:00:26,230

Let's start with risks you're aware of,
they're called known unknowns, things like



6
5
00:00:26,230 --> 00:00:29,720

weather delays or
resources being unavailable.

7

6
00:00:30,490 --> 00:00:34,990

Let's look at some examples of things
that can introduce risk to projects.



8
7
00:00:35,880 --> 00:00:42,660

Technology, it might cost more than you expect, not
work the way it's supposed to or not

9


8
00:00:42,660 --> 00:00:44,130

show up when you need it.

10


9
00:00:44,760 --> 00:00:48,300

A widely dispersed project
team can increase risk.

11


10
00:00:49,140 --> 00:00:54,540

You could have delays due to
time zone differences, miscommunication from different

11

12

00:00:54,540 --> 00:01:00,420
languages or cultures, or lack of teamwork
because remote team members haven't developed

13


12
00:01:00,420 --> 00:01:02,280

effective working relationships.

14


13
00:01:03,450 --> 00:01:08,940

Lack of detail, like specifics on deliverables, due
dates or who will work on your

15


14
00:01:08,940 --> 00:01:12,270

project can lead to all sorts of problems.

16


15
00:01:13,080 --> 00:01:19,140
Limited options, like people with rare skills
increase risk because you don't have easy

17


16
00:01:19,140 --> 00:01:22,560

alternatives to apply if a problem arises.

18


17
00:01:23,710 --> 00:01:30,070

Work with everyone on your team to identify
risks, you can ask experts for different

19


18
00:01:30,070 --> 00:01:36,070

parts of the project about the risks they foresee
as key people on the project, what they

20


19
00:01:36,070 --> 00:01:40,930

think and ask other project managers
about risks from similar projects.

21


20
00:01:41,920 --> 00:01:49,270

Fill out a risk information form for each risk
you identify, include as much detail as you

21
00:

22
01:49,270 --> 00:01:56,260

can, which objectives are in danger, what events
can cause the risk to occur, what the

22
00:
01:56,260 --> 00:01:59,890

23

consequences are, who owns the
risk, and so on.



24
23
00:02:01,110 --> 00:02:07,320

Up until now, we've talked about risks we can
anticipate, but what do you do about the



25
24
00:02:07,320 --> 00:02:09,060

risks you can't predict?

26


25
00:02:09,960 --> 00:02:17,130

These are called unknown unknowns, they come
from situations that are so unlikely that



27
26
00:02:17,130 --> 00:02:23,430

they never occur to you the 9/11 attack
was an event that no one thought possible.


28

27
00:02:24,390 --> 00:02:30,090

You're unlikely to have to deal with such
a significant unknown risk, but you will

29


28
00:02:30,090 --> 00:02:34,620

encounter unknown risks at some point and
you need to plan for them.


30

29
00:02:35,230 --> 00:02:40,750

How? By setting aside contingency funds
and time for dealing with them.



31
30
00:02:41,580 --> 00:02:44,920

The question is, how much
should you set aside?

32


31
00:02:45,420 --> 00:02:51,690

Many companies use a percentage of the project
budget like 15 percent, but the percentage

33


32
00:02:51,690 --> 00:02:54,420

is typically based on past experience.

34


33
00:02:55,170 --> 00:03:01,200

To minimize the effect of risks, you first
have to identify the risks that your project

35


34
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:08,250

faces. Try to identify several risks that
the hospital scheduling project might face for

36


35
00:03:08,250 --> 00:03:09,290

an extra challenge.

37


36
00:03:09,330 --> 00:03:14,730

Use the risk information form in the
exercise files to document the risks.
