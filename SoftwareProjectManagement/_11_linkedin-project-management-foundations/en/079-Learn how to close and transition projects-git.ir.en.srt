1
00:00:00,640 --> 00:00:03,679
at the very end of a project there are a

2
00:00:03,040 --> 00:00:07,200
few

3
00:00:03,679 --> 00:00:10,800
pesky but important details to tie up

4
00:00:07,200 --> 00:00:12,799
first close any contracts you signed

5
00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:13,920
if your project included a contract with

6
00:00:12,799 --> 00:00:16,080
the customer

7
00:00:13,920 --> 00:00:18,080
the signed acceptance form means the

8
00:00:16,080 --> 00:00:20,560
customer agrees that the contract

9
00:00:18,080 --> 00:00:21,279
is complete depending on the contract's

10
00:00:20,560 --> 00:00:23,920
terms

11
00:00:21,279 --> 00:00:26,160
you might have other things to do like

12
00:00:23,920 --> 00:00:29,359
support the project's deliverables

13
00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:31,359
or perform a follow-up in a few months

14
00:00:29,359 --> 00:00:33,920
once the scheduling system is in

15
00:00:31,359 --> 00:00:36,160
operation you'll run reports to see

16
00:00:33,920 --> 00:00:37,760
whether hospital performance objectives

17
00:00:36,160 --> 00:00:40,640
have been met

18
00:00:37,760 --> 00:00:41,120
with vendor contracts confirm that they

19
00:00:40,640 --> 00:00:44,000
did

20
00:00:41,120 --> 00:00:46,320
what they're supposed to do then close

21
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:48,320
those contracts as well

22
00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:49,520
what if another group picks up where

23
00:00:48,320 --> 00:00:52,399
your project team

24
00:00:49,520 --> 00:00:53,120
leaves off make sure that the ongoing

25
00:00:52,399 --> 00:00:55,120
group is

26
00:00:53,120 --> 00:00:56,239
ready to take over when the project

27
00:00:55,120 --> 00:00:59,440
becomes part of

28
00:00:56,239 --> 00:01:02,160
day-to-day operations for example

29
00:00:59,440 --> 00:01:04,640
the hospital i.t department takes over

30
00:01:02,160 --> 00:01:06,640
maintenance of the scheduling system

31
00:01:04,640 --> 00:01:08,960
and the schedulers start using the

32
00:01:06,640 --> 00:01:11,360
system in their daily work

33
00:01:08,960 --> 00:01:12,000
as project manager help your team

34
00:01:11,360 --> 00:01:14,240
transition

35
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:15,439
to their next assignments the best

36
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:17,680
approach is to give

37
00:01:15,439 --> 00:01:19,840
functional managers advance notice that

38
00:01:17,680 --> 00:01:21,600
their people will be available

39
00:01:19,840 --> 00:01:24,960
then the managers can find new

40
00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:28,000
assignments and plan the transitions

41
00:01:24,960 --> 00:01:30,400
archive all your project information

42
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:32,159
archiving information electronically

43
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:34,720
makes it easy to find

44
00:01:32,159 --> 00:01:36,640
and share depending on the technology

45
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:38,560
that's available in your company

46
00:01:36,640 --> 00:01:39,840
you might keep your project files on a

47
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:42,560
network drive

48
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:44,159
in a database or a document management

49
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:47,040
system

50
00:01:44,159 --> 00:01:48,880
finally close the accounts you use to

51
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:51,280
bill the project costs

52
00:01:48,880 --> 00:01:53,040
for most projects you keep the financial

53
00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:55,759
books open for a few months

54
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:56,799
after the project is complete that way

55
00:01:55,759 --> 00:01:59,680
you can process

56
00:01:56,799 --> 00:02:00,240
follow-on expenses like support to

57
00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:02,880
prevent

58
00:02:00,240 --> 00:02:03,920
erroneous charges close all the

59
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:05,920
accounting codes

60
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:08,239
except for the ones related to the

61
00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:10,479
follow-up activities

62
00:02:08,239 --> 00:02:11,280
with these tasks taken care of your

63
00:02:10,479 --> 00:02:14,720
project

64
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:15,920
is truly complete and your assignment as

65
00:02:14,720 --> 00:02:19,200
project manager

66
00:02:15,920 --> 00:02:22,160
is over take a moment or two

67
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:23,120
to celebrate what you've accomplished

68
00:02:22,160 --> 00:02:28,000
okay

69
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:28,000
now you're ready for your next project
