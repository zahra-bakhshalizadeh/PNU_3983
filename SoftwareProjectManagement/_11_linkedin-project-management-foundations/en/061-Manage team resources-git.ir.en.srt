1
00:00:00,880 --> 00:00:03,600
team members are the ones who get things

2
00:00:03,199 --> 00:00:06,720
done

3
00:00:03,600 --> 00:00:09,040
and achieve the project objectives

4
00:00:06,720 --> 00:00:10,400
you have to motivate the people who work

5
00:00:09,040 --> 00:00:12,799
on your project

6
00:00:10,400 --> 00:00:15,040
even though they usually report directly

7
00:00:12,799 --> 00:00:16,640
to someone else

8
00:00:15,040 --> 00:00:18,800
let's look at several methods to

9
00:00:16,640 --> 00:00:21,920
strengthen your working relationships

10
00:00:18,800 --> 00:00:24,080
and motivate your team members

11
00:00:21,920 --> 00:00:26,960
clearly communicate roles and

12
00:00:24,080 --> 00:00:28,880
responsibilities to your team members

13
00:00:26,960 --> 00:00:30,640
you can build your relationships with

14
00:00:28,880 --> 00:00:33,040
them by helping them understand

15
00:00:30,640 --> 00:00:35,360
what they're responsible for and what

16
00:00:33,040 --> 00:00:38,480
you expect of them

17
00:00:35,360 --> 00:00:42,079
next give people specific

18
00:00:38,480 --> 00:00:44,559
and achievable goals team members

19
00:00:42,079 --> 00:00:46,239
usually dig deeper to respond to

20
00:00:44,559 --> 00:00:48,480
challenges

21
00:00:46,239 --> 00:00:50,960
provide support and help remove

22
00:00:48,480 --> 00:00:53,440
obstacles that get in the way

23
00:00:50,960 --> 00:00:54,960
if your people can't resolve issues or

24
00:00:53,440 --> 00:00:58,079
remove obstacles

25
00:00:54,960 --> 00:01:00,079
help them in any way you can

26
00:00:58,079 --> 00:01:02,079
that way they can focus on the work

27
00:01:00,079 --> 00:01:05,199
they're supposed to do

28
00:01:02,079 --> 00:01:07,200
respect your people they're crucial

29
00:01:05,199 --> 00:01:09,200
components to your project

30
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:11,040
because project work wouldn't get done

31
00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:13,360
without them

32
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:15,600
being respectful helps you get the best

33
00:01:13,360 --> 00:01:19,200
your team has to offer

34
00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:21,520
also provide feedback quickly providing

35
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:22,720
positive reinforcement quickly helps

36
00:01:21,520 --> 00:01:25,280
build rapport

37
00:01:22,720 --> 00:01:26,400
and people will do more of what works

38
00:01:25,280 --> 00:01:28,640
well

39
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:30,799
if someone does something wrong jump in

40
00:01:28,640 --> 00:01:32,000
quickly to explain what they should be

41
00:01:30,799 --> 00:01:36,040
doing

42
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:40,320
in a tactful way another important point

43
00:01:36,040 --> 00:01:42,720
consistently tell the truth

44
00:01:40,320 --> 00:01:43,840
by telling the truth you earn people's

45
00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:47,200
trust

46
00:01:43,840 --> 00:01:50,079
even if they don't like what they hear

47
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:52,960
if you can explain why you're making the

48
00:01:50,079 --> 00:01:55,600
requests or decisions that you do

49
00:01:52,960 --> 00:01:57,280
next communicate regularly with team

50
00:01:55,600 --> 00:01:59,600
members

51
00:01:57,280 --> 00:02:01,600
status and lessons learned meetings are

52
00:01:59,600 --> 00:02:02,159
great ways to find out what people are

53
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:05,040
doing

54
00:02:02,159 --> 00:02:05,759
and how well they're doing it and of

55
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:08,239
course

56
00:02:05,759 --> 00:02:10,160
comparing their progress to the baseline

57
00:02:08,239 --> 00:02:13,520
shows whether they're as productive

58
00:02:10,160 --> 00:02:15,920
as you expected them to be finally

59
00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:17,360
handle people problems quickly if they

60
00:02:15,920 --> 00:02:20,160
come up

61
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:22,879
the answer could be as easy as telling

62
00:02:20,160 --> 00:02:24,640
someone what they're supposed to do

63
00:02:22,879 --> 00:02:26,879
or explaining the effect they're having

64
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:29,360
on others

65
00:02:26,879 --> 00:02:30,480
it's important to be upfront while at

66
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:34,239
the same time

67
00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:37,599
being tactful and respectful

68
00:02:34,239 --> 00:02:39,280
if it turns out someone isn't qualified

69
00:02:37,599 --> 00:02:40,720
think about how you can help them

70
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:42,879
succeed

71
00:02:40,720 --> 00:02:44,879
or find someone else to help or take

72
00:02:42,879 --> 00:02:47,440
over the work

73
00:02:44,879 --> 00:02:48,400
if this situation comes up check your

74
00:02:47,440 --> 00:02:50,879
work packages

75
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:53,760
and resource requests make sure you

76
00:02:50,879 --> 00:02:56,480
define them clearly

77
00:02:53,760 --> 00:02:57,920
if you have to replace someone work with

78
00:02:56,480 --> 00:03:01,440
the functional manager

79
00:02:57,920 --> 00:03:02,560
to get someone else if you can't replace

80
00:03:01,440 --> 00:03:04,959
the person

81
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:06,000
you might have to reset stakeholders

82
00:03:04,959 --> 00:03:09,040
expectations

83
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:10,319
about when work will get done how much

84
00:03:09,040 --> 00:03:13,360
it'll cost

85
00:03:10,319 --> 00:03:15,760
or maybe the quality

86
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:18,080
these techniques help build effective

87
00:03:15,760 --> 00:03:19,840
working relationships and motivate team

88
00:03:18,080 --> 00:03:22,640
members

89
00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:24,959
to solidify your understanding write up

90
00:03:22,640 --> 00:03:25,760
a sample of what you would say to your

91
00:03:24,959 --> 00:03:29,599
team members

92
00:03:25,760 --> 00:03:29,599
in your kickoff meeting
