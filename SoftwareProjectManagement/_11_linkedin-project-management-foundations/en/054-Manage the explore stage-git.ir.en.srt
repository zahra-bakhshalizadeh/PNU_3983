1
00:00:00,640 --> 00:00:06,160
agile projects get you to the explore

2
00:00:03,360 --> 00:00:06,720
stage quickly this is where the team

3
00:00:06,160 --> 00:00:09,200
starts

4
00:00:06,720 --> 00:00:10,080
building and implementing features at

5
00:00:09,200 --> 00:00:12,639
this stage

6
00:00:10,080 --> 00:00:14,880
a lot of collaboration occurs between

7
00:00:12,639 --> 00:00:16,560
the business and technical folks

8
00:00:14,880 --> 00:00:18,640
the bulk of the effort in the explore

9
00:00:16,560 --> 00:00:22,160
stage is working on the features

10
00:00:18,640 --> 00:00:24,160
assigned to the current iteration

11
00:00:22,160 --> 00:00:26,320
the business and technical team members

12
00:00:24,160 --> 00:00:27,119
start each day with a short stand-up

13
00:00:26,320 --> 00:00:30,000
meeting

14
00:00:27,119 --> 00:00:30,480
usually 15 minutes while these meetings

15
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,200
occur

16
00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:35,200
during all agile stages they are key

17
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:37,680
during the explore stage

18
00:00:35,200 --> 00:00:39,600
each person briefs the team on what they

19
00:00:37,680 --> 00:00:42,480
completed the day before

20
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:44,160
what they plan to finish today and any

21
00:00:42,480 --> 00:00:46,800
help they need

22
00:00:44,160 --> 00:00:48,480
if issues come up you don't resolve them

23
00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:51,039
in the daily meeting

24
00:00:48,480 --> 00:00:52,000
instead make a note of them but work on

25
00:00:51,039 --> 00:00:54,640
resolving them

26
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:55,280
after the meeting the people who tackle

27
00:00:54,640 --> 00:00:57,360
the issue

28
00:00:55,280 --> 00:00:58,960
report on it to the group in the next

29
00:00:57,360 --> 00:01:00,960
day's meeting

30
00:00:58,960 --> 00:01:02,960
the only documentation that comes out of

31
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:03,600
the meeting is adding issues to a

32
00:01:02,960 --> 00:01:07,439
register

33
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:09,920
to track lessons learned the team

34
00:01:07,439 --> 00:01:10,640
runs these meetings that doesn't mean

35
00:01:09,920 --> 00:01:13,520
you as

36
00:01:10,640 --> 00:01:14,400
project manager have nothing to do your

37
00:01:13,520 --> 00:01:16,880
main job

38
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:19,520
is to remove obstacles so team members

39
00:01:16,880 --> 00:01:21,759
can focus on their work

40
00:01:19,520 --> 00:01:24,080
during the meeting you track progress on

41
00:01:21,759 --> 00:01:26,720
the features planned for this iteration

42
00:01:24,080 --> 00:01:28,080
if features are behind schedule you need

43
00:01:26,720 --> 00:01:30,880
to find out why

44
00:01:28,080 --> 00:01:32,240
and help get things back on track if

45
00:01:30,880 --> 00:01:34,320
issues are to blame

46
00:01:32,240 --> 00:01:36,159
add them and their solutions to the

47
00:01:34,320 --> 00:01:38,880
issue log

48
00:01:36,159 --> 00:01:39,280
speaking of issues keep an eye on any

49
00:01:38,880 --> 00:01:41,600
that

50
00:01:39,280 --> 00:01:43,119
aren't getting resolved and offer to

51
00:01:41,600 --> 00:01:45,360
help

52
00:01:43,119 --> 00:01:47,600
as with any meeting if it starts to go

53
00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:50,640
off track you can jump in to help

54
00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:51,439
refocus the team's attention after the

55
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:55,200
meetings

56
00:01:51,439 --> 00:01:57,600
notify stakeholders of progress

57
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:58,640
here's a key concept with the agile

58
00:01:57,600 --> 00:02:00,880
approach

59
00:01:58,640 --> 00:02:03,680
you stop working on features when the

60
00:02:00,880 --> 00:02:06,560
iteration is scheduled to end

61
00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:07,600
even if the features aren't done for

62
00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:10,479
example

63
00:02:07,600 --> 00:02:12,319
if your explore stage is four weeks you

64
00:02:10,479 --> 00:02:14,959
stop at four weeks

65
00:02:12,319 --> 00:02:16,239
if features are incomplete you put the

66
00:02:14,959 --> 00:02:19,120
incomplete work

67
00:02:16,239 --> 00:02:20,480
into the backlog to address in a future

68
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:22,720
iteration

69
00:02:20,480 --> 00:02:24,000
on the other hand if the team cranks out

70
00:02:22,720 --> 00:02:26,640
the iteration features

71
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:28,480
faster than they estimated you can start

72
00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:29,200
working on another feature from the

73
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:32,239
backlog

74
00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:34,640
to fill in the rest of the time the

75
00:02:32,239 --> 00:02:36,400
explore stage is mostly about building

76
00:02:34,640 --> 00:02:38,879
and implementing features

77
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:40,319
with short daily meetings to help keep

78
00:02:38,879 --> 00:02:43,120
things on track

79
00:02:40,319 --> 00:02:43,680
for practice create a checklist for

80
00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:46,560
things

81
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:51,599
you as project manager should watch for

82
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:51,599
during the daily stand-up meetings
