1
00:00:00,719 --> 00:00:05,040
as project manager you need to know

2
00:00:03,120 --> 00:00:06,799
who has a stake in the outcome of your

3
00:00:05,040 --> 00:00:10,400
project they're called

4
00:00:06,799 --> 00:00:12,799
stakeholders they include the customer

5
00:00:10,400 --> 00:00:13,920
project sponsor departments involved

6
00:00:12,799 --> 00:00:17,279
with the project

7
00:00:13,920 --> 00:00:19,119
and people who work on project tasks

8
00:00:17,279 --> 00:00:21,520
you need to know what they expect from

9
00:00:19,119 --> 00:00:22,880
the project and how they contribute to

10
00:00:21,520 --> 00:00:25,119
it

11
00:00:22,880 --> 00:00:25,920
it's vital to understand stakeholders

12
00:00:25,119 --> 00:00:28,960
importance

13
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:31,119
influence and interest in the project

14
00:00:28,960 --> 00:00:33,120
that way you can build relationships

15
00:00:31,119 --> 00:00:35,200
with influential stakeholders

16
00:00:33,120 --> 00:00:36,880
and make sure they're satisfied with

17
00:00:35,200 --> 00:00:38,879
project results

18
00:00:36,880 --> 00:00:40,800
let's start by identifying major

19
00:00:38,879 --> 00:00:43,040
stakeholder roles

20
00:00:40,800 --> 00:00:44,079
the project customer is the person or

21
00:00:43,040 --> 00:00:46,399
group with a problem

22
00:00:44,079 --> 00:00:48,399
to solve for the hospital scheduling

23
00:00:46,399 --> 00:00:50,800
project the coo

24
00:00:48,399 --> 00:00:52,640
oversees scheduling so she is the

25
00:00:50,800 --> 00:00:54,879
customer

26
00:00:52,640 --> 00:00:57,440
the project customer brings three

27
00:00:54,879 --> 00:01:00,800
crucial things to a project

28
00:00:57,440 --> 00:01:04,559
first the customer funds the project

29
00:01:00,800 --> 00:01:07,119
in the hospital the ceo oversees the

30
00:01:04,559 --> 00:01:09,520
overall budget for the new cancer wing

31
00:01:07,119 --> 00:01:12,960
and operational improvements

32
00:01:09,520 --> 00:01:15,520
but the hospital coo is in charge of the

33
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:18,159
budget for the scheduling project

34
00:01:15,520 --> 00:01:20,560
second the customer has a lot to say

35
00:01:18,159 --> 00:01:23,119
about what the project will do

36
00:01:20,560 --> 00:01:25,360
third the customer approves deliverables

37
00:01:23,119 --> 00:01:27,920
from start to finish

38
00:01:25,360 --> 00:01:29,040
the next stakeholder role is project

39
00:01:27,920 --> 00:01:31,360
sponsor

40
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:33,360
the sponsor is someone who wants to see

41
00:01:31,360 --> 00:01:35,680
the project succeed

42
00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:37,200
and has enough formal authority to help

43
00:01:35,680 --> 00:01:39,200
make that happen

44
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:41,600
like an executive who believes in the

45
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:42,560
project for the scheduling project the

46
00:01:41,600 --> 00:01:46,240
coo

47
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:47,360
is also the project sponsor she wants to

48
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:49,280
see it succeed

49
00:01:47,360 --> 00:01:51,680
because she believes effective

50
00:01:49,280 --> 00:01:53,520
scheduling not only improves patient

51
00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:56,079
care and medical results

52
00:01:53,520 --> 00:01:57,920
but also produces better financial

53
00:01:56,079 --> 00:02:00,079
results

54
00:01:57,920 --> 00:02:02,079
her position gives her enough authority

55
00:02:00,079 --> 00:02:05,520
to champion the project

56
00:02:02,079 --> 00:02:07,360
a sponsor can help prioritize objectives

57
00:02:05,520 --> 00:02:09,360
talk to stakeholders who aren't being

58
00:02:07,360 --> 00:02:13,200
supportive and suggest

59
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:15,440
improvements to the project plan

60
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:16,239
the third type of stakeholder is a

61
00:02:15,440 --> 00:02:20,000
functional

62
00:02:16,239 --> 00:02:22,000
or line manager functional managers run

63
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:25,120
departments and are accountable for

64
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:26,319
achieving their department's goals they

65
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:27,040
also manage the people in their

66
00:02:26,319 --> 00:02:29,520
departments

67
00:02:27,040 --> 00:02:31,760
who are the ones you need to staff your

68
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:35,280
project

69
00:02:31,760 --> 00:02:37,599
team members are also stakeholders

70
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:39,920
while they're assigned to your project

71
00:02:37,599 --> 00:02:43,040
their jobs depend on their assignments

72
00:02:39,920 --> 00:02:46,319
and may depend on how well they perform

73
00:02:43,040 --> 00:02:49,120
finally there are departments or people

74
00:02:46,319 --> 00:02:51,280
who affect the project and there are

75
00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:52,959
departments or people who are affected

76
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:54,800
by it

77
00:02:52,959 --> 00:02:56,560
both of these groups are project

78
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:59,040
stakeholders

79
00:02:56,560 --> 00:03:01,519
for example the project will affect how

80
00:02:59,040 --> 00:03:03,599
hospital facilities are scheduled

81
00:03:01,519 --> 00:03:07,280
so the facilities department is a

82
00:03:03,599 --> 00:03:09,760
stakeholder in the scheduling project

83
00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:12,000
as a project manager you need to know a

84
00:03:09,760 --> 00:03:13,360
lot about stakeholders in order to keep

85
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:18,800
them happy

86
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:18,800
the first step is knowing who they are
