1
00:00:00,719 --> 00:00:04,720
project estimates are a lot like your

2
00:00:03,360 --> 00:00:06,640
morning commute

3
00:00:04,720 --> 00:00:08,880
you need to choose an estimate that

4
00:00:06,640 --> 00:00:10,080
gives you a good chance of getting where

5
00:00:08,880 --> 00:00:12,880
you need to be

6
00:00:10,080 --> 00:00:15,200
when you need to be there on some days

7
00:00:12,880 --> 00:00:18,400
your commute is a breeze

8
00:00:15,200 --> 00:00:20,320
maybe 30 minutes most days let's say

9
00:00:18,400 --> 00:00:24,000
it's 45 minutes

10
00:00:20,320 --> 00:00:26,320
but an accident can turn it into an hour

11
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:28,320
for your commute you choose a drive time

12
00:00:26,320 --> 00:00:30,880
that gives you some wiggle room so you

13
00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:32,880
get to work on time the same approach

14
00:00:30,880 --> 00:00:34,239
works equally well for your project

15
00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:36,559
estimates

16
00:00:34,239 --> 00:00:38,640
you probably decide when to leave for

17
00:00:36,559 --> 00:00:40,879
work informally

18
00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:43,120
we're going to look at a similar yet

19
00:00:40,879 --> 00:00:45,200
rigorous approach to choosing estimate

20
00:00:43,120 --> 00:00:47,039
values for your project

21
00:00:45,200 --> 00:00:48,399
if you were to graph the probability of

22
00:00:47,039 --> 00:00:50,559
your commute times

23
00:00:48,399 --> 00:00:51,760
it would look like a bell curve with

24
00:00:50,559 --> 00:00:55,360
your average drive

25
00:00:51,760 --> 00:00:55,760
time at the peak a bell curve is also

26
00:00:55,360 --> 00:00:58,719
known

27
00:00:55,760 --> 00:01:00,559
as a normal distribution and it has

28
00:00:58,719 --> 00:01:04,080
properties that help you choose

29
00:01:00,559 --> 00:01:07,200
a safe estimate to give your customer

30
00:01:04,080 --> 00:01:08,799
first on a bell curve fifty percent of

31
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:11,280
the possible values are

32
00:01:08,799 --> 00:01:12,560
less than the average and fifty percent

33
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:15,840
are greater

34
00:01:12,560 --> 00:01:19,040
that means the average value gives you a

35
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:21,360
50 50 chance of your results being equal

36
00:01:19,040 --> 00:01:24,080
to or less than your estimate

37
00:01:21,360 --> 00:01:24,400
think about it if you give your customer

38
00:01:24,080 --> 00:01:27,119
your

39
00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:27,600
average estimate you're as likely to

40
00:01:27,119 --> 00:01:30,640
fail

41
00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:33,119
as you are to succeed i wouldn't stake

42
00:01:30,640 --> 00:01:35,280
my career on those odds

43
00:01:33,119 --> 00:01:37,680
on the other hand the worst case

44
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:38,960
estimate gives you the highest chance of

45
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:42,000
success

46
00:01:38,960 --> 00:01:45,759
however that number is so high

47
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:47,840
your customer might cancel the project

48
00:01:45,759 --> 00:01:49,360
you probably know that customers are

49
00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:52,240
prone to ask

50
00:01:49,360 --> 00:01:53,680
what's the best case scenario what if

51
00:01:52,240 --> 00:01:56,880
everything goes right

52
00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:58,799
don't fall for this trap

53
00:01:56,880 --> 00:01:59,920
suppose you give the customer your best

54
00:01:58,799 --> 00:02:02,960
case estimate

55
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:05,119
say six months and you describe

56
00:02:02,960 --> 00:02:07,600
everything that has to go right to

57
00:02:05,119 --> 00:02:10,720
finish the project in six months

58
00:02:07,600 --> 00:02:11,440
this is what they'll hear blah blah blah

59
00:02:10,720 --> 00:02:13,920
blah

60
00:02:11,440 --> 00:02:16,400
six months and you've set up your

61
00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:19,760
project to fail

62
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:21,280
we've eliminated the best worst and most

63
00:02:19,760 --> 00:02:23,760
likely values

64
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:26,319
you're probably wondering what number

65
00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:29,520
you should use for your estimate

66
00:02:26,319 --> 00:02:30,160
the answer is about halfway between the

67
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:33,200
average

68
00:02:30,160 --> 00:02:35,360
and worst case values let's go back to

69
00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:37,760
the bell curve and pick the value

70
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:39,120
halfway between the average and worst

71
00:02:37,760 --> 00:02:40,879
case values

72
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:42,800
without getting into the mathematical

73
00:02:40,879 --> 00:02:45,760
details that gives you

74
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:46,800
an 86 percent probability of your

75
00:02:45,760 --> 00:02:49,680
results being

76
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:50,000
less than or equal to that number that's

77
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:53,120
a

78
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:56,239
good chance of success and the value

79
00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:58,480
is easy to calculate plus

80
00:02:56,239 --> 00:03:00,080
you can tweak your value higher to

81
00:02:58,480 --> 00:03:01,120
reduce the chance of missing the

82
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:03,440
deadline

83
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:05,360
just like you would leave extra early if

84
00:03:03,440 --> 00:03:07,280
you're going to a job interview

85
00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:09,920
and if you're trying to win a project

86
00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:11,840
you might choose a smaller value

87
00:03:09,920 --> 00:03:12,959
even though the risk of failure is

88
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:15,760
higher

89
00:03:12,959 --> 00:03:16,720
the bottom line is choose the estimate

90
00:03:15,760 --> 00:03:20,159
that provides

91
00:03:16,720 --> 00:03:22,879
an acceptable probability of success

92
00:03:20,159 --> 00:03:25,360
for practice use the information in the

93
00:03:22,879 --> 00:03:26,080
exercise files to determine the time

94
00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:31,519
estimate

95
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:31,519
you would give the hospital co
