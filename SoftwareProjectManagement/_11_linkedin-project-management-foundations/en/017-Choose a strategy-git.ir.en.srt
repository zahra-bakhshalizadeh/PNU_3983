1
00:00:00,719 --> 00:00:04,640
you're likely to find that there's more

2
00:00:02,560 --> 00:00:06,720
than one way to achieve your project

3
00:00:04,640 --> 00:00:08,639
goal and objectives

4
00:00:06,720 --> 00:00:10,080
let's look at how you can evaluate

5
00:00:08,639 --> 00:00:13,440
alternative strategies

6
00:00:10,080 --> 00:00:16,240
and select the right solution

7
00:00:13,440 --> 00:00:16,720
first bring together a small group of

8
00:00:16,240 --> 00:00:19,119
people

9
00:00:16,720 --> 00:00:20,960
familiar with the project to brainstorm

10
00:00:19,119 --> 00:00:23,600
strategies

11
00:00:20,960 --> 00:00:25,279
as a group read the problem statement

12
00:00:23,600 --> 00:00:27,519
goal and objectives

13
00:00:25,279 --> 00:00:29,599
and then begin generating possible

14
00:00:27,519 --> 00:00:32,160
strategies

15
00:00:29,599 --> 00:00:33,440
brainstorming should be a free flow of

16
00:00:32,160 --> 00:00:35,520
ideas

17
00:00:33,440 --> 00:00:36,880
the point is to get as many ideas

18
00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:40,079
written down as possible

19
00:00:36,880 --> 00:00:42,399
before you begin evaluating them once

20
00:00:40,079 --> 00:00:44,559
you've identified possible strategies

21
00:00:42,399 --> 00:00:47,039
you evaluate them

22
00:00:44,559 --> 00:00:48,719
a decision matrix helps you compare the

23
00:00:47,039 --> 00:00:52,000
options

24
00:00:48,719 --> 00:00:54,640
first the group should evaluate how well

25
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:56,559
each strategy satisfies the project

26
00:00:54,640 --> 00:00:58,800
objectives

27
00:00:56,559 --> 00:00:59,680
one way to quickly shorten the list of

28
00:00:58,800 --> 00:01:02,559
contenders

29
00:00:59,680 --> 00:01:03,199
is to check whether a strategy satisfies

30
00:01:02,559 --> 00:01:06,400
all the

31
00:01:03,199 --> 00:01:08,880
must-have objectives if a strategy

32
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:10,479
doesn't satisfy one of your must-haves

33
00:01:08,880 --> 00:01:12,400
you don't have to fill out the rest of

34
00:01:10,479 --> 00:01:15,520
the values for that strategy

35
00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:18,000
like option 4 in this example

36
00:01:15,520 --> 00:01:19,520
next rate the performance for each

37
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:21,759
objective

38
00:01:19,520 --> 00:01:22,880
when some objectives are more important

39
00:01:21,759 --> 00:01:26,400
than others

40
00:01:22,880 --> 00:01:27,439
increase their weighting the strategy

41
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:29,759
with the highest

42
00:01:27,439 --> 00:01:31,680
overall rating is most likely your

43
00:01:29,759 --> 00:01:33,840
winner

44
00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:35,439
for the top strategy from the decision

45
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:39,360
matrix the group then

46
00:01:35,439 --> 00:01:42,399
asks is this strategy feasible

47
00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:44,720
for example strategies that use new

48
00:01:42,399 --> 00:01:48,320
technology or unproven methods

49
00:01:44,720 --> 00:01:49,119
might not work if feasibility could be

50
00:01:48,320 --> 00:01:51,439
an issue

51
00:01:49,119 --> 00:01:53,200
a feasibility study can explore whether

52
00:01:51,439 --> 00:01:55,280
the strategy will work

53
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:57,200
without committing too much time or

54
00:01:55,280 --> 00:01:59,520
money

55
00:01:57,200 --> 00:02:02,159
next consider whether the strategies

56
00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:04,159
risks are acceptable

57
00:02:02,159 --> 00:02:06,880
you won't know all the risks at this

58
00:02:04,159 --> 00:02:09,920
point you can perform an initial

59
00:02:06,880 --> 00:02:10,239
risk analysis to see whether any risks

60
00:02:09,920 --> 00:02:12,879
are

61
00:02:10,239 --> 00:02:14,239
so significant and likely that a

62
00:02:12,879 --> 00:02:17,360
different strategy

63
00:02:14,239 --> 00:02:19,840
makes more sense finally consider

64
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:22,080
whether the strategy fits the culture of

65
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:24,400
the organization

66
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:25,599
trying to force a strategy that doesn't

67
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:28,879
fit with the culture

68
00:02:25,599 --> 00:02:30,800
is a losing battle believe me

69
00:02:28,879 --> 00:02:34,000
you won't get the commitment you need

70
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:36,720
from management or team members

71
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:38,480
evaluating alternative strategies helps

72
00:02:36,720 --> 00:02:40,319
you pick the right solution for your

73
00:02:38,480 --> 00:02:42,879
project

74
00:02:40,319 --> 00:02:44,480
practice by using the decision matrix in

75
00:02:42,879 --> 00:02:47,280
the exercise files

76
00:02:44,480 --> 00:02:50,959
to evaluate strategies for the hospital

77
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:50,959
scheduling project
