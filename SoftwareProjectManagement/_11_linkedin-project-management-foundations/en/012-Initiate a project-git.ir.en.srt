1
00:00:00,960 --> 00:00:05,600
initiating a project is about getting

2
00:00:03,199 --> 00:00:07,919
commitment to move forward

3
00:00:05,600 --> 00:00:09,920
in other words the customer or sponsor

4
00:00:07,919 --> 00:00:13,440
says yes to the project

5
00:00:09,920 --> 00:00:15,440
and gives the go-ahead to start planning

6
00:00:13,440 --> 00:00:17,760
typically the first step in project

7
00:00:15,440 --> 00:00:18,720
initiation is to assign the project

8
00:00:17,760 --> 00:00:20,560
manager

9
00:00:18,720 --> 00:00:23,199
who guides the project through the rest

10
00:00:20,560 --> 00:00:24,800
of the initiation process

11
00:00:23,199 --> 00:00:26,880
sometimes the project manager is

12
00:00:24,800 --> 00:00:28,320
assigned after the project's been

13
00:00:26,880 --> 00:00:31,039
approved

14
00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:32,399
if you find yourself in this situation

15
00:00:31,039 --> 00:00:34,960
be sure to review

16
00:00:32,399 --> 00:00:35,600
what was done during initiation and

17
00:00:34,960 --> 00:00:37,920
complete

18
00:00:35,600 --> 00:00:39,840
any activities that were skipped or left

19
00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:42,160
unfinished

20
00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:44,640
the customer or sponsor should make an

21
00:00:42,160 --> 00:00:46,000
informed decision whether to approve the

22
00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:48,160
project

23
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:50,960
that's why initiation boils down to

24
00:00:48,160 --> 00:00:53,120
defining the project

25
00:00:50,960 --> 00:00:54,399
you identify the problem the project is

26
00:00:53,120 --> 00:00:57,360
supposed to solve

27
00:00:54,399 --> 00:00:58,320
and gather information about the project

28
00:00:57,360 --> 00:01:01,920
objectives

29
00:00:58,320 --> 00:01:03,520
requirements deliverables and more

30
00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:06,000
once you have an initial project

31
00:01:03,520 --> 00:01:09,280
definition it's time to prepare

32
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:11,760
the project charter this document

33
00:01:09,280 --> 00:01:14,159
formally authorizes the project and

34
00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:15,520
describes the authority of the project

35
00:01:14,159 --> 00:01:17,680
manager

36
00:01:15,520 --> 00:01:21,200
throughout this chapter i'll describe

37
00:01:17,680 --> 00:01:26,880
the key elements of a project definition

38
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:26,880
and what goes into a project charter
