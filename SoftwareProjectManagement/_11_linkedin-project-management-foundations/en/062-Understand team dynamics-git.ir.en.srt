1
00:00:00,780 --> 00:00:06,510
People who work on your project may be working
together for the first time, you know how

2
00:00:06,510 --> 00:00:11,969
it goes when people are getting to know one
another. Work progresses in fits and starts

3
00:00:11,969 --> 00:00:18,750
while folks learn how to work together. To
get high quality results and productivity

4
00:00:18,750 --> 00:00:27,040
from your people, you have to help them develop
into a team. Like people do, teams grow up

5
00:00:27,040 --> 00:00:33,649
through several stages before they're truly
productive. One model that describes the typical

6
00:00:33,649 --> 00:00:41,100
phases the teams go through is called Forming,
Storming, Norming and Performing. Bruce Tuckman

7
00:00:41,100 --> 00:00:49,829
proposed it back in 1965. The first team stage
is called forming because the individuals

8
00:00:49,829 --> 00:00:55,710
are just starting to form into a team, they
aren't sure of their goal as a team and they

9
00:00:55,710 --> 00:01:02,870
don't know who does what. During the forming
stage, you as their leader, have to clearly

10
00:01:02,870 --> 00:01:09,820
define the team's goals and give them direction.
Like other youngsters, teams in the forming

11
00:01:09,820 --> 00:01:16,689
stage tend to resist and challenge authority.
So be prepared to answer their questions and

12
00:01:16,689 --> 00:01:24,509
earn their respect, the second stage is called
storming because things with teams usually

13
00:01:24,509 --> 00:01:30,549
get worse before they get better. As team
members start to work out their relationships

14
00:01:30,549 --> 00:01:38,479
with each other, power struggles often occur.
Storming teams have difficulty making decisions

15
00:01:38,479 --> 00:01:45,780
because of disagreements. The good news is
that those disagreements lead to communication,

16
00:01:45,780 --> 00:01:52,969
which helps people grow as a team. When a
team is storming, you have to help them stay

17
00:01:52,969 --> 00:01:59,321
focused on their goals and help them make
decisions after the storm has passed, you

18
00:01:59,321 --> 00:02:06,810
finally have a team that's the norming stage.
The team understands their common goal and

19
00:02:06,810 --> 00:02:13,560
everyone pitches in to be successful. Teams
don't always reach the performing stage, but

20
00:02:13,560 --> 00:02:19,650
if they do, it's pretty impressive they know
what they're supposed to accomplish. Who's

21
00:02:19,650 --> 00:02:26,620
supposed to do what? And they often get things
done very quickly, all without any help from

22
00:02:26,620 --> 00:02:33,629
you. You only have to step in if the team
asks. Helping your people develop as a team

23
00:02:33,629 --> 00:02:41,190
will help your project run smoothly and deliver
quality results. For practice review, the

24
00:02:41,190 --> 00:02:46,160
case study in the exercise files and determine
which stage the team is in.
