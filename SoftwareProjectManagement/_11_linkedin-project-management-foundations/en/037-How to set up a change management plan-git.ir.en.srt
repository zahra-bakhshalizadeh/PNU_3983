1
00:00:00,640 --> 00:00:04,319
the government tax code started out so

2
00:00:03,280 --> 00:00:07,440
simple

3
00:00:04,319 --> 00:00:09,440
but a deduction here a new rule there

4
00:00:07,440 --> 00:00:11,519
and now we have the complicated tax

5
00:00:09,440 --> 00:00:14,559
returns of today

6
00:00:11,519 --> 00:00:17,680
you know changes are going to happen so

7
00:00:14,559 --> 00:00:20,480
the only solution is to manage them

8
00:00:17,680 --> 00:00:21,680
a change management plan helps you add

9
00:00:20,480 --> 00:00:24,400
important changes

10
00:00:21,680 --> 00:00:27,119
into your project while keeping out the

11
00:00:24,400 --> 00:00:29,279
ones that don't make sense

12
00:00:27,119 --> 00:00:30,880
first you identify what you want to

13
00:00:29,279 --> 00:00:33,680
control

14
00:00:30,880 --> 00:00:34,880
like the project's scope requirements

15
00:00:33,680 --> 00:00:38,000
and the schedule

16
00:00:34,880 --> 00:00:39,440
or perhaps the entire project plan the

17
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:42,480
versions you control

18
00:00:39,440 --> 00:00:44,559
are called baseline documents

19
00:00:42,480 --> 00:00:46,320
the list of project requirements

20
00:00:44,559 --> 00:00:49,440
approved by the stakeholders

21
00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:50,399
is your baseline if new requirements are

22
00:00:49,440 --> 00:00:53,199
suggested

23
00:00:50,399 --> 00:00:54,000
you use your change management process

24
00:00:53,199 --> 00:00:55,840
to decide

25
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:57,520
whether or not to add them to the

26
00:00:55,840 --> 00:00:59,520
requirements list

27
00:00:57,520 --> 00:01:01,680
you also need a group that reviews

28
00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:03,039
change requests and decides whether to

29
00:01:01,680 --> 00:01:05,600
approve them

30
00:01:03,039 --> 00:01:07,200
it's called the change review board and

31
00:01:05,600 --> 00:01:10,400
it's usually made up of

32
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:13,600
key stakeholders then you define

33
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:16,240
a change management process that's

34
00:01:13,600 --> 00:01:17,759
what will happen when someone requests a

35
00:01:16,240 --> 00:01:20,320
change

36
00:01:17,759 --> 00:01:22,000
the process your organization chooses

37
00:01:20,320 --> 00:01:22,560
depends on things like the company

38
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:25,840
culture

39
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:26,640
and project size here are the typical

40
00:01:25,840 --> 00:01:30,079
components

41
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:30,720
of change management processes the first

42
00:01:30,079 --> 00:01:33,280
process

43
00:01:30,720 --> 00:01:34,799
is documenting and submitting a change

44
00:01:33,280 --> 00:01:37,200
request

45
00:01:34,799 --> 00:01:39,439
use a standardized change request form

46
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:42,240
that requesters fill out

47
00:01:39,439 --> 00:01:43,600
it's easier to evaluate changes because

48
00:01:42,240 --> 00:01:46,079
each request has the

49
00:01:43,600 --> 00:01:48,159
information the review board needs to

50
00:01:46,079 --> 00:01:50,560
make decisions

51
00:01:48,159 --> 00:01:51,759
include details about the requested

52
00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:54,000
change

53
00:01:51,759 --> 00:01:55,119
the reason it's needed the business

54
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:58,399
justification

55
00:01:55,119 --> 00:02:01,280
and the results it should produce

56
00:01:58,399 --> 00:02:03,280
next someone has to evaluate the request

57
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:05,600
and estimate its impact

58
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:06,320
as project manager you can assign this

59
00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:08,800
task to

60
00:02:06,320 --> 00:02:09,520
someone on your team the evaluator

61
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:12,480
determines

62
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:14,239
whether the change is needed if it is

63
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:16,560
the person evaluates whether the

64
00:02:14,239 --> 00:02:19,599
suggested approach is correct

65
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:21,920
or if an alternative would be better

66
00:02:19,599 --> 00:02:24,080
the evaluator estimates the effort and

67
00:02:21,920 --> 00:02:26,560
costs the change would require

68
00:02:24,080 --> 00:02:27,360
the impact on the project and whether it

69
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:31,599
introduces

70
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:34,720
risks third the change review board

71
00:02:31,599 --> 00:02:37,040
reviews evaluated change requests the

72
00:02:34,720 --> 00:02:38,000
board might accept or reject the change

73
00:02:37,040 --> 00:02:40,560
request

74
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:42,160
they also might ask for more detail or

75
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:44,640
revisions

76
00:02:42,160 --> 00:02:48,080
be sure to communicate the decision to

77
00:02:44,640 --> 00:02:50,319
the person who requested the change

78
00:02:48,080 --> 00:02:52,800
for approved requests you update the

79
00:02:50,319 --> 00:02:55,200
baseline documents to reflect the change

80
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:56,319
for example your project schedule might

81
00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:59,519
need new tasks

82
00:02:56,319 --> 00:03:02,840
or deadlines extended finally

83
00:02:59,519 --> 00:03:05,440
track where change requests are in your

84
00:03:02,840 --> 00:03:07,760
process a change request log

85
00:03:05,440 --> 00:03:08,800
shows the status of submitted change

86
00:03:07,760 --> 00:03:11,120
requests

87
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:12,879
who's in charge of the request the

88
00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:16,840
impact estimate

89
00:03:12,879 --> 00:03:19,200
current status and at the end actual

90
00:03:16,840 --> 00:03:22,560
impact consider setting

91
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:25,200
thresholds so team leads can decide what

92
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:27,920
to do with smaller requests

93
00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:30,000
that way your change management process

94
00:03:27,920 --> 00:03:33,120
isn't overwhelmed with small

95
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:35,680
items also create a process for

96
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:36,319
emergency changes that need a rapid

97
00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:38,480
decision

98
00:03:36,319 --> 00:03:40,000
between meetings of the change review

99
00:03:38,480 --> 00:03:42,400
board

100
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:44,640
a change management plan helps you

101
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:45,599
include changes that make sense in your

102
00:03:44,640 --> 00:03:47,599
project

103
00:03:45,599 --> 00:03:48,640
while protecting your project from being

104
00:03:47,599 --> 00:03:51,680
overwhelmed with

105
00:03:48,640 --> 00:03:54,480
unnecessary changes to solidify

106
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:56,319
your understanding of change management

107
00:03:54,480 --> 00:03:58,480
draw a flowchart of the change

108
00:03:56,319 --> 00:04:01,840
management processes the hospital

109
00:03:58,480 --> 00:04:01,840
might use
