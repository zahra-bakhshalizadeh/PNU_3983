0:00:05.670 --> 0:00:10.710
For this challenge, I'd like you to consider
a challenging situation that has come up in

0:00:10.710 --> 0:00:16.240
the hospital scheduling project. You decide
to hold a face to face meeting with your team

0:00:16.240 --> 0:00:22.820
to brainstorm alternative solutions. Using
the background provided in the exercise files

0:00:22.820 --> 0:00:29.420
take about 10 to 15 minutes to draft the agenda
for this meeting. After you put your agenda

0:00:29.420 --> 0:00:31.960
together, take a look at the agenda I built.
