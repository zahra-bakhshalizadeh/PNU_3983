1
00:00:00,880 --> 00:00:07,200
finally planning is done

2
00:00:03,760 --> 00:00:09,760
and the project is underway now

3
00:00:07,200 --> 00:00:11,840
all the work you did in planning comes

4
00:00:09,760 --> 00:00:13,759
into play as you push your project to

5
00:00:11,840 --> 00:00:15,920
completion

6
00:00:13,759 --> 00:00:17,920
executing a project starts with lining

7
00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:20,640
up the people and other resources you

8
00:00:17,920 --> 00:00:23,119
need to perform the work

9
00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:23,920
once team members are on board they need

10
00:00:23,119 --> 00:00:26,320
to know

11
00:00:23,920 --> 00:00:26,960
their assignments who they're working

12
00:00:26,320 --> 00:00:30,000
with

13
00:00:26,960 --> 00:00:33,200
and how the project's going to go

14
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:34,880
that's what a kickoff meeting is for the

15
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:36,399
project sponsor and customer can

16
00:00:34,880 --> 00:00:38,559
describe the mission

17
00:00:36,399 --> 00:00:39,520
and get everybody jazzed about the

18
00:00:38,559 --> 00:00:41,680
project

19
00:00:39,520 --> 00:00:42,640
you can review the project plan and

20
00:00:41,680 --> 00:00:45,200
explain

21
00:00:42,640 --> 00:00:46,160
how things will work like communicating

22
00:00:45,200 --> 00:00:49,680
or handling

23
00:00:46,160 --> 00:00:50,480
change requests you also set up a place

24
00:00:49,680 --> 00:00:52,719
to store

25
00:00:50,480 --> 00:00:54,480
project information like your project

26
00:00:52,719 --> 00:00:57,600
plan specifications

27
00:00:54,480 --> 00:01:01,359
documents and reports it's

28
00:00:57,600 --> 00:01:04,640
called a project notebook but these days

29
00:01:01,359 --> 00:01:04,960
it's usually electronic lots of people

30
00:01:04,640 --> 00:01:07,840
need

31
00:01:04,960 --> 00:01:09,760
access to these files so be sure to set

32
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:12,479
your project notebook up where team

33
00:01:09,760 --> 00:01:15,600
members can get to it

34
00:01:12,479 --> 00:01:17,840
after that project execution represents

35
00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:20,960
performing all the work you identified

36
00:01:17,840 --> 00:01:23,439
in the work breakdown structure

37
00:01:20,960 --> 00:01:27,520
monitoring and controlling your project

38
00:01:23,439 --> 00:01:30,479
kick in at the same time as executing

39
00:01:27,520 --> 00:01:32,880
monitoring means collecting data about

40
00:01:30,479 --> 00:01:35,280
where the project stands

41
00:01:32,880 --> 00:01:37,360
since projects never stick to the plans

42
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:39,520
you so carefully prepare

43
00:01:37,360 --> 00:01:40,640
you have to figure out how to respond to

44
00:01:39,520 --> 00:01:44,399
the changes

45
00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:47,439
and surprises and problems that arise

46
00:01:44,399 --> 00:01:50,880
controlling is about correcting course

47
00:01:47,439 --> 00:01:52,960
to get your project back on track

48
00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:57,759
in this chapter i'll talk about what

49
00:01:52,960 --> 00:01:57,759
goes on during the executing phase
