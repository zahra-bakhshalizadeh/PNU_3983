00:00:00,510 --> 00:00:04,560

Even with homemade chicken soup, you
don't make everything from scratch.


2

2
00:00:05,190 --> 00:00:10,350

Imagine how long it would take and how much it
would cost if you had to raise your own

4


3
00:00:10,350 --> 00:00:14,200

chickens, vegetable and wheat and
make chicken stock and noodles.

5


4
00:00:14,640 --> 00:00:16,800

The same goes in the project world.

6


5
00:00:17,190 --> 00:00:22,530

Procuring products, services and skills can be a
lot quicker than trying to do everything



7
6
00:00:22,530 --> 00:00:28,110

yourself. When you purchase items from outside
your organization, you need to plan how


8
7
00:00:28,110 --> 00:00:30,420

you're going to do that. You guessed it.



9
8
00:00:30,990 --> 00:00:33,450

That's what a procurement plan is for.



10
9
00:00:34,450 --> 00:00:37,250

First, you identify what
you need to purchase.

11


10
00:00:37,660 --> 00:00:42,610

Maybe you need people with specific skills or
you need more people than your organization



17
11
00:00:42,610 --> 00:00:46,280

has, or the project
requires products and materials.

18


12
00:00:47,200 --> 00:00:50,740

Second, you document
your procurement processes.

19


13
00:00:51,190 --> 00:00:52,570

Who handles procurement?



20
14
00:00:52,990 --> 00:00:57,880

Is it the purchasing department, the project
team or a combination of the two?



21
15
00:00:58,390 --> 00:01:04,420

The plan describes criteria for choosing
vendors, the selection process, types of

22


16
00:01:04,420 --> 00:01:08,230

contracts you use and how
you manage those contracts.


23

17
00:01:09,100 --> 00:01:13,480

Fortunately, you usually don't have
to invent all these processes.

24


18
00:01:13,900 --> 00:01:18,200

Most organizations already have
procurement processes in place.

25


19
00:01:18,820 --> 00:01:23,070

Talk to your purchasing department or finance
group to find out how it's done.

26


20
00:01:24,110 --> 00:01:31,550

Third, you describe your make or buy decision
process, basically how you decide whether to

27


21
00:01:31,550 --> 00:01:35,180

use in-house products or
services or procure them.

28


22
00:01:36,110 --> 00:01:41,000

To make an informed make or buy
decision, it's important to understand your needs.

29


23
00:01:41,540 --> 00:01:45,650

Make sure your requirements are
clear and then prioritize them.

30


24
00:01:46,220 --> 00:01:49,940

That way, it's easier to pick
products that meet your requirements.



31
25
00:01:50,570 --> 00:01:54,200

Plus, you can resist bells
and whistles you don't need.



32
26
00:01:55,260 --> 00:02:01,470

You have to see if a product that meets
your needs is available, if it is, evaluate how



33
27
00:02:01,470 --> 00:02:03,420

it matches up with your requirements.

34


28
00:02:04,470 --> 00:02:10,830

Before you finalize your decision, consider the pros
and cons of making versus buying if


35


29
00:02:10,830 --> 00:02:16,180

your project is on a tight timeline,
buying is probably the right choice.

36


30
00:02:16,980 --> 00:02:22,620

The last part of the procurement plan is a
list of potential vendors who offer what you



37
31
00:02:22,620 --> 00:02:28,950

need to purchase. Describe how you researched
vendors and contractors and the criteria



38
32
00:02:28,950 --> 00:02:30,540

for developing the list.

39


33
00:02:31,540 --> 00:02:37,000

Procurement planning helps you make smart
decisions about whether to purchase products



40
34
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:43,510

and services, and if you do, which products
and services to procure as an exercise,



41
35
00:02:43,750 --> 00:02:49,120

identify some of the criteria you might
use to choose the scheduling system vendor.
