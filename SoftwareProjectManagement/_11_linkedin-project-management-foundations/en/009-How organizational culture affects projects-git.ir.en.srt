1
00:00:00,799 --> 00:00:05,200
organizational culture is a set of

2
00:00:03,040 --> 00:00:08,160
factors that guide people's behaviors

3
00:00:05,200 --> 00:00:10,960
and decisions within an organization

4
00:00:08,160 --> 00:00:12,240
things like shared values beliefs

5
00:00:10,960 --> 00:00:15,920
assumptions

6
00:00:12,240 --> 00:00:18,000
habits and language let's talk about how

7
00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:21,760
organizational culture affects

8
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:23,920
projects the organization's mission

9
00:00:21,760 --> 00:00:25,119
and vision shape the organization's

10
00:00:23,920 --> 00:00:26,720
culture

11
00:00:25,119 --> 00:00:28,320
projects that support the company

12
00:00:26,720 --> 00:00:31,679
mission are likely to get

13
00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:33,520
more attention and resources when you're

14
00:00:31,679 --> 00:00:36,000
faced with a tricky decision

15
00:00:33,520 --> 00:00:37,840
you can use the mission to determine the

16
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:40,000
best thing to do

17
00:00:37,840 --> 00:00:42,399
leadership and authority are also a big

18
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:44,800
part of organizational culture

19
00:00:42,399 --> 00:00:46,719
if management defines clear goals and

20
00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:47,680
then delegates responsibility to

21
00:00:46,719 --> 00:00:49,680
employees

22
00:00:47,680 --> 00:00:51,440
that approach will also work in your

23
00:00:49,680 --> 00:00:53,840
projects

24
00:00:51,440 --> 00:00:55,440
on the other hand if authority isn't

25
00:00:53,840 --> 00:00:57,840
handed out often

26
00:00:55,440 --> 00:00:59,120
you need to work with management to get

27
00:00:57,840 --> 00:01:01,039
things done

28
00:00:59,120 --> 00:01:03,920
and build their trust in you at the same

29
00:01:01,039 --> 00:01:06,640
time another aspect of culture is the

30
00:01:03,920 --> 00:01:08,880
organization's work environment

31
00:01:06,640 --> 00:01:11,040
with a positive environment people are

32
00:01:08,880 --> 00:01:12,799
motivated to get things done

33
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:14,320
and gathering lessons learned is

34
00:01:12,799 --> 00:01:16,400
relatively easy

35
00:01:14,320 --> 00:01:19,520
because employees are used to providing

36
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:21,360
input and striving to improve

37
00:01:19,520 --> 00:01:23,360
in a negative environment you're

38
00:01:21,360 --> 00:01:23,840
probably going to have to spend a lot of

39
00:01:23,360 --> 00:01:27,520
time

40
00:01:23,840 --> 00:01:29,040
managing your team some cultures believe

41
00:01:27,520 --> 00:01:32,479
in following the rules

42
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:33,840
no matter what other cultures nurture

43
00:01:32,479 --> 00:01:35,600
innovation

44
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:36,880
expecting employees to try new

45
00:01:35,600 --> 00:01:39,360
approaches

46
00:01:36,880 --> 00:01:40,000
question what's been done before and

47
00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:43,280
come up with

48
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:45,520
better methods you don't have to follow

49
00:01:43,280 --> 00:01:47,280
the rules in a rules-based culture

50
00:01:45,520 --> 00:01:49,600
but if you're thinking about breaking

51
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:50,000
rules it's important to know which ones

52
00:01:49,600 --> 00:01:52,560
you

53
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:53,200
can break and also think about what

54
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:55,439
you'll do

55
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:57,360
if your non-standard approach doesn't

56
00:01:55,439 --> 00:01:59,759
work

57
00:01:57,360 --> 00:02:00,799
does your organization put results ahead

58
00:01:59,759 --> 00:02:03,920
of procedures

59
00:02:00,799 --> 00:02:06,240
or vice versa that is

60
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:08,720
is it better to follow the rules even if

61
00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:11,599
you don't achieve the objective

62
00:02:08,720 --> 00:02:14,879
or can you do whatever it takes as long

63
00:02:11,599 --> 00:02:17,680
as you deliver the desired results

64
00:02:14,879 --> 00:02:19,360
a project's goal is always to achieve

65
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:21,200
its objectives

66
00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:24,319
but it's important to know where the

67
00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:26,480
boundaries are in making things happen

68
00:02:24,319 --> 00:02:28,480
change management can be affected by

69
00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:31,120
organizational culture

70
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:33,040
if the organization is risk averse

71
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:35,840
change management might include

72
00:02:33,040 --> 00:02:36,800
multiple rounds of review and require

73
00:02:35,840 --> 00:02:40,000
approval from

74
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:42,640
several people on the other hand

75
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:44,720
if change is viewed simply as life in

76
00:02:42,640 --> 00:02:48,319
the project management world

77
00:02:44,720 --> 00:02:50,560
change management might be a lot simpler

78
00:02:48,319 --> 00:02:52,480
with people working in locations around

79
00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:54,800
the country or the world

80
00:02:52,480 --> 00:02:57,120
you also need to consider the cultures

81
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:58,640
of your team members

82
00:02:57,120 --> 00:03:01,200
people may react differently to

83
00:02:58,640 --> 00:03:04,319
situations or communicate differently

84
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:06,800
based on the norms of their cultures

85
00:03:04,319 --> 00:03:09,040
for example in some cultures people are

86
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:11,360
taught not to show weakness

87
00:03:09,040 --> 00:03:13,680
and that behavior could be interpreted

88
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:15,680
as arrogance by people from other

89
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:18,080
cultures

90
00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:19,920
culture has a strong influence on how

91
00:03:18,080 --> 00:03:23,280
things happen within projects

92
00:03:19,920 --> 00:03:25,680
and how decisions are made to increase

93
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:26,319
your success you need to manage your

94
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:32,319
projects

95
00:03:26,319 --> 00:03:32,319
taking cultural factors into account
