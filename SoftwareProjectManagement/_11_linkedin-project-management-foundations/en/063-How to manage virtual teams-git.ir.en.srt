1
00:00:00,640 --> 00:00:04,480
have you ever been on the phone trying

2
00:00:02,879 --> 00:00:05,279
to tell someone how to put something

3
00:00:04,480 --> 00:00:07,120
together

4
00:00:05,279 --> 00:00:09,040
when neither of you can see what the

5
00:00:07,120 --> 00:00:11,519
other person is doing

6
00:00:09,040 --> 00:00:12,719
project teams spread across the country

7
00:00:11,519 --> 00:00:15,839
or globe

8
00:00:12,719 --> 00:00:17,760
present the same kinds of issues

9
00:00:15,839 --> 00:00:18,800
distance and lack of face-to-face

10
00:00:17,760 --> 00:00:22,640
communication

11
00:00:18,800 --> 00:00:24,640
makes managing virtual teams a challenge

12
00:00:22,640 --> 00:00:26,240
when people aren't in the same location

13
00:00:24,640 --> 00:00:27,439
it can be hard to understand what

14
00:00:26,240 --> 00:00:30,480
they're saying

15
00:00:27,439 --> 00:00:32,880
it's easy to misinterpret their meanings

16
00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:34,719
and unless you can video conference you

17
00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:35,360
don't get the benefit of reading body

18
00:00:34,719 --> 00:00:38,719
language

19
00:00:35,360 --> 00:00:39,440
or facial expressions that's why you

20
00:00:38,719 --> 00:00:41,760
need

21
00:00:39,440 --> 00:00:43,760
really good communication to manage

22
00:00:41,760 --> 00:00:46,879
virtual teams

23
00:00:43,760 --> 00:00:50,239
it's tough but not impossible to build

24
00:00:46,879 --> 00:00:52,559
long distance relationships the same

25
00:00:50,239 --> 00:00:53,280
interpersonal skills you use with office

26
00:00:52,559 --> 00:00:56,399
mates

27
00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:59,600
work with remote team members too

28
00:00:56,399 --> 00:01:02,640
be clear in your communication

29
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:05,600
confirm understanding be supportive

30
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:08,400
and respectful take care of your people

31
00:01:05,600 --> 00:01:10,720
and help them overcome obstacles

32
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:13,159
and don't forget to thank them and tell

33
00:01:10,720 --> 00:01:16,080
them when they do good work

34
00:01:13,159 --> 00:01:17,920
misunderstandings communication issues

35
00:01:16,080 --> 00:01:20,960
cultural differences

36
00:01:17,920 --> 00:01:24,080
these all can create conflict

37
00:01:20,960 --> 00:01:25,680
it's never easy to resolve conflict it's

38
00:01:24,080 --> 00:01:29,759
even more challenging with

39
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:31,520
virtual teams email is too impersonal

40
00:01:29,759 --> 00:01:33,600
for delicate discussions

41
00:01:31,520 --> 00:01:35,600
plus it can lead to even more

42
00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:38,720
misunderstanding

43
00:01:35,600 --> 00:01:41,680
instead use phone or video conferencing

44
00:01:38,720 --> 00:01:44,560
to work through conflict

45
00:01:41,680 --> 00:01:46,399
speaking of phone and video conferencing

46
00:01:44,560 --> 00:01:48,320
figuring out when to hold a group

47
00:01:46,399 --> 00:01:51,439
session can be tough

48
00:01:48,320 --> 00:01:52,799
someone's usually up really late or much

49
00:01:51,439 --> 00:01:54,399
too early

50
00:01:52,799 --> 00:01:57,280
once you sort out the best time for

51
00:01:54,399 --> 00:01:57,680
calls hold an initial session to talk

52
00:01:57,280 --> 00:02:00,719
about

53
00:01:57,680 --> 00:02:02,719
how communication will work on the team

54
00:02:00,719 --> 00:02:05,280
those are just a few of the challenges

55
00:02:02,719 --> 00:02:07,840
you might face with virtual teams

56
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:08,959
and some tips on handling them for

57
00:02:07,840 --> 00:02:10,959
practice

58
00:02:08,959 --> 00:02:12,239
come up with a solution to the virtual

59
00:02:10,959 --> 00:02:17,120
team situation

60
00:02:12,239 --> 00:02:17,120
