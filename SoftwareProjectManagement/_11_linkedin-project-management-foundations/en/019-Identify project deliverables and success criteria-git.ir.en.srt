1
00:00:00,640 --> 00:00:06,319
put simply project deliverables

2
00:00:03,199 --> 00:00:08,400
are the results that a project delivers

3
00:00:06,319 --> 00:00:09,920
to determine whether deliverables are

4
00:00:08,400 --> 00:00:12,719
what they're supposed to be

5
00:00:09,920 --> 00:00:13,519
you need some way to measure them those

6
00:00:12,719 --> 00:00:16,960
measurements

7
00:00:13,519 --> 00:00:19,439
are called success criteria

8
00:00:16,960 --> 00:00:20,080
deliverables can be tangible like a

9
00:00:19,439 --> 00:00:23,199
building

10
00:00:20,080 --> 00:00:26,240
a new product or a new service

11
00:00:23,199 --> 00:00:28,560
they can also be more abstract like

12
00:00:26,240 --> 00:00:31,840
improved results

13
00:00:28,560 --> 00:00:34,719
say a decrease in reported errors

14
00:00:31,840 --> 00:00:35,680
deliverables help you define the project

15
00:00:34,719 --> 00:00:38,719
scope

16
00:00:35,680 --> 00:00:42,000
which basically means what is and isn't

17
00:00:38,719 --> 00:00:44,239
included in the project deliverables

18
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:45,039
then help you measure progress while

19
00:00:44,239 --> 00:00:48,079
your project

20
00:00:45,039 --> 00:00:49,200
is underway to document project

21
00:00:48,079 --> 00:00:52,640
deliverables

22
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:54,480
start by listing the end deliverables

23
00:00:52,640 --> 00:00:56,719
that is the results your project

24
00:00:54,480 --> 00:00:58,960
delivers at the end of the project

25
00:00:56,719 --> 00:01:01,280
for example one end deliverable for the

26
00:00:58,960 --> 00:01:03,840
scheduling project would be

27
00:01:01,280 --> 00:01:05,439
new scheduling system and processes

28
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:08,479
launched

29
00:01:05,439 --> 00:01:10,400
next document intermediate deliverables

30
00:01:08,479 --> 00:01:11,680
which are delivered during the course of

31
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:13,439
the project

32
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:15,520
an intermediate deliverable for the

33
00:01:13,439 --> 00:01:17,439
scheduling project would be to sign a

34
00:01:15,520 --> 00:01:18,640
contract with the scheduling system

35
00:01:17,439 --> 00:01:21,040
vendor

36
00:01:18,640 --> 00:01:22,400
keep in mind the project customer

37
00:01:21,040 --> 00:01:25,360
doesn't necessarily

38
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:26,159
receive intermediate deliverables for

39
00:01:25,360 --> 00:01:27,840
example

40
00:01:26,159 --> 00:01:30,560
you might have an intermediate

41
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:33,280
deliverable for completion of initial

42
00:01:30,560 --> 00:01:35,280
system testing that the customer doesn't

43
00:01:33,280 --> 00:01:37,520
have to approve

44
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:38,880
try to define deliverables that can be

45
00:01:37,520 --> 00:01:42,079
accomplished in the time

46
00:01:38,880 --> 00:01:43,759
frame between status reports that way

47
00:01:42,079 --> 00:01:45,759
you can evaluate progress

48
00:01:43,759 --> 00:01:48,479
based on the deliverables completed

49
00:01:45,759 --> 00:01:49,920
since the last report

50
00:01:48,479 --> 00:01:51,920
now that you've identified your

51
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:53,119
deliverables how can you tell that the

52
00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:55,840
ones you receive

53
00:01:53,119 --> 00:01:57,280
are what the stakeholders want you

54
00:01:55,840 --> 00:02:00,000
guessed it

55
00:01:57,280 --> 00:02:01,280
you need quantifiable criteria you can

56
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:04,079
measure them with

57
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:04,719
success criteria are definitions of what

58
00:02:04,079 --> 00:02:07,520
success

59
00:02:04,719 --> 00:02:10,000
looks like some are easy to figure out

60
00:02:07,520 --> 00:02:12,000
like signed vendor contracts

61
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:13,120
or the certificate of occupancy for a

62
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:15,680
building

63
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:17,280
other criteria are not so easy because

64
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:20,319
they're subjective

65
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:23,280
to be effective write success criteria

66
00:02:20,319 --> 00:02:24,480
that are clear and quantifiable for the

67
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:26,720
scheduling project

68
00:02:24,480 --> 00:02:28,720
you might define success for increased

69
00:02:26,720 --> 00:02:31,200
customer satisfaction

70
00:02:28,720 --> 00:02:32,640
as a four out of five rating on customer

71
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:34,800
surveys

72
00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:37,360
deliverables are the results your

73
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:40,000
project is supposed to deliver

74
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:41,519
success criteria help you determine

75
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:44,640
whether those deliverables

76
00:02:41,519 --> 00:02:46,879
are what you need for practice

77
00:02:44,640 --> 00:02:48,319
try to identify some end and

78
00:02:46,879 --> 00:02:50,319
intermediate deliverables for the

79
00:02:48,319 --> 00:02:53,120
hospital scheduling project

80
00:02:50,319 --> 00:02:53,680
then define success criteria that are

81
00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:57,680
clear

82
00:02:53,680 --> 00:02:57,680
and quantifiable
