1
00:00:00,719 --> 00:00:04,080
after all the work you put into defining

2
00:00:03,040 --> 00:00:06,799
your project

3
00:00:04,080 --> 00:00:08,400
it's time to get that project definition

4
00:00:06,799 --> 00:00:11,040
in writing

5
00:00:08,400 --> 00:00:12,880
project scope is the culmination of your

6
00:00:11,040 --> 00:00:15,040
definition work

7
00:00:12,880 --> 00:00:16,080
it describes the boundaries of the

8
00:00:15,040 --> 00:00:17,920
project

9
00:00:16,080 --> 00:00:20,640
what is included in the scope of the

10
00:00:17,920 --> 00:00:24,240
project and just as important

11
00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:25,760
what isn't included it's important to

12
00:00:24,240 --> 00:00:29,439
get the project scope

13
00:00:25,760 --> 00:00:32,480
in writing otherwise you're bound to run

14
00:00:29,439 --> 00:00:35,520
into scope creep

15
00:00:32,480 --> 00:00:38,960
that isn't some weird guy who casts

16
00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:41,680
foot of glances at your project scope

17
00:00:38,960 --> 00:00:43,360
scope creep is when stakeholders ask

18
00:00:41,680 --> 00:00:46,000
questions like

19
00:00:43,360 --> 00:00:46,800
can you do this one thing we forgot to

20
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:49,600
ask for this

21
00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:49,920
can you add it to the project and you

22
00:00:49,600 --> 00:00:52,320
say

23
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:55,440
yes without running the change through

24
00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:57,440
your change management process

25
00:00:55,440 --> 00:00:59,760
the other reason you want project scope

26
00:00:57,440 --> 00:01:00,800
in writing is to remind stakeholders

27
00:00:59,760 --> 00:01:03,199
what they agreed to

28
00:01:00,800 --> 00:01:04,400
at the beginning of the project if

29
00:01:03,199 --> 00:01:08,080
someone says

30
00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:09,920
i thought you were going to do x y and z

31
00:01:08,080 --> 00:01:12,080
you can go back to the scope statement

32
00:01:09,920 --> 00:01:13,520
and show them that those items are out

33
00:01:12,080 --> 00:01:15,439
of scope

34
00:01:13,520 --> 00:01:17,040
if they really want those things in the

35
00:01:15,439 --> 00:01:20,080
project you can use

36
00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:22,640
change management to add them

37
00:01:20,080 --> 00:01:25,600
a scope statement is a document that

38
00:01:22,640 --> 00:01:27,600
spells out the project's scope

39
00:01:25,600 --> 00:01:28,640
everything you've done during project

40
00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:31,759
initiation

41
00:01:28,640 --> 00:01:33,280
feeds into this document the goal and

42
00:01:31,759 --> 00:01:36,320
objectives

43
00:01:33,280 --> 00:01:40,320
deliverables and success criteria

44
00:01:36,320 --> 00:01:42,399
assumptions risks and constraints

45
00:01:40,320 --> 00:01:45,280
here's what is within scope for the

46
00:01:42,399 --> 00:01:48,079
hospital scheduling project

47
00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:49,520
your scope statement also includes an

48
00:01:48,079 --> 00:01:51,520
out-of-scope section

49
00:01:49,520 --> 00:01:52,960
that shows what the project doesn't

50
00:01:51,520 --> 00:01:55,680
include

51
00:01:52,960 --> 00:01:56,799
for example the scheduling project

52
00:01:55,680 --> 00:01:58,960
doesn't include an

53
00:01:56,799 --> 00:02:01,280
update to the system used to assign

54
00:01:58,960 --> 00:02:03,040
staff to work shifts

55
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:05,600
scheduling resident rooms in the

56
00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:08,879
hospital and rehabilitation wing is

57
00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:12,080
also out of scope keeping scope

58
00:02:08,879 --> 00:02:13,280
under control is one key to a successful

59
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:15,360
project

60
00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:16,800
use the scope statement template in the

61
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:19,120
exercise files folder

62
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:23,680
to create a scope statement for the

63
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:23,680
hospital scheduling project
