1
00:00:00,799 --> 00:00:05,520
if your project goes off the rails

2
00:00:03,600 --> 00:00:07,600
it's time to figure out how to get it

3
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:10,080
back on track

4
00:00:07,600 --> 00:00:10,960
the approach you choose and how you get

5
00:00:10,080 --> 00:00:14,000
permission

6
00:00:10,960 --> 00:00:15,839
depend on several factors if your

7
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:17,680
project is behind schedule

8
00:00:15,839 --> 00:00:19,119
you can look at techniques like fast

9
00:00:17,680 --> 00:00:21,199
tracking crashing

10
00:00:19,119 --> 00:00:23,920
and assigning overtime to pull the

11
00:00:21,199 --> 00:00:26,720
finish date earlier

12
00:00:23,920 --> 00:00:27,439
when cost is over budget you might

13
00:00:26,720 --> 00:00:30,080
consider

14
00:00:27,439 --> 00:00:32,320
less expensive resources or reducing

15
00:00:30,080 --> 00:00:34,880
other types of costs

16
00:00:32,320 --> 00:00:36,399
as a last resort you might think about

17
00:00:34,880 --> 00:00:38,800
reducing scope

18
00:00:36,399 --> 00:00:40,719
because it can shorten the schedule and

19
00:00:38,800 --> 00:00:45,200
reduce cost

20
00:00:40,719 --> 00:00:46,960
start with solutions you can authorize

21
00:00:45,200 --> 00:00:49,280
that way you don't have to ask

22
00:00:46,960 --> 00:00:51,680
permission to make changes

23
00:00:49,280 --> 00:00:53,440
for example you might shuffle task

24
00:00:51,680 --> 00:00:56,480
assignments to complete work

25
00:00:53,440 --> 00:00:59,840
more quickly or at lower cost without

26
00:00:56,480 --> 00:01:03,359
affecting anyone outside the project

27
00:00:59,840 --> 00:01:05,920
no need to ask for approval go ahead and

28
00:01:03,359 --> 00:01:08,400
reassign if you don't have enough

29
00:01:05,920 --> 00:01:10,840
authority to implement a solution

30
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:12,240
ask your customer or stakeholders for

31
00:01:10,840 --> 00:01:14,880
approval

32
00:01:12,240 --> 00:01:15,600
lengthening the schedule increasing the

33
00:01:14,880 --> 00:01:18,560
budget

34
00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:20,000
and reducing scope usually require an

35
00:01:18,560 --> 00:01:22,880
okay from the customer

36
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:24,080
sponsor or management team when you ask

37
00:01:22,880 --> 00:01:26,400
for approval

38
00:01:24,080 --> 00:01:29,280
present your recommendations along with

39
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:31,360
the pros and cons of each one

40
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:33,360
and be ready to answer questions about

41
00:01:31,360 --> 00:01:36,720
the solution you recommend

42
00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:37,920
and the ones you ruled out when your

43
00:01:36,720 --> 00:01:40,400
organization runs

44
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:43,520
many projects you might have to go

45
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:46,000
beyond your project stakeholders

46
00:01:43,520 --> 00:01:48,479
for example if you need contingency

47
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:50,159
funds or people from other projects

48
00:01:48,479 --> 00:01:52,799
you'll probably have to ask the

49
00:01:50,159 --> 00:01:54,640
management team for those

50
00:01:52,799 --> 00:01:56,159
no matter how well you manage your

51
00:01:54,640 --> 00:01:59,200
projects they'll go

52
00:01:56,159 --> 00:02:02,479
off track from time to time don't

53
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:05,920
panic evaluate your options and

54
00:02:02,479 --> 00:02:07,200
ask for help effectively the scheduling

55
00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:10,239
project in the exercise

56
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:12,560
files is behind schedule

57
00:02:10,239 --> 00:02:14,560
based on the background provided choose

58
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:15,680
an approach to shorten the remaining

59
00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:18,360
schedule

60
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:21,360
and identify who you will ask for

61
00:02:18,360 --> 00:02:21,360
permission
