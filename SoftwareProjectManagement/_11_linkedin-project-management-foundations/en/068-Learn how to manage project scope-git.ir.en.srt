1
00:00:00,719 --> 00:00:04,480
stakeholders might push to add things to

2
00:00:03,120 --> 00:00:06,720
your project's scope

3
00:00:04,480 --> 00:00:08,080
that's natural as everyone learns more

4
00:00:06,720 --> 00:00:11,120
about the project

5
00:00:08,080 --> 00:00:13,679
problem is stakeholders aren't so keen

6
00:00:11,120 --> 00:00:16,240
to increase the budget or lengthen the

7
00:00:13,679 --> 00:00:17,920
schedule to include those things that's

8
00:00:16,240 --> 00:00:20,880
why you need to manage

9
00:00:17,920 --> 00:00:21,680
scope that tendency for scope to

10
00:00:20,880 --> 00:00:25,439
increase

11
00:00:21,680 --> 00:00:26,960
is called scope creep and it's as nasty

12
00:00:25,439 --> 00:00:29,679
as it sounds

13
00:00:26,960 --> 00:00:31,279
someone catches you in the hall says hey

14
00:00:29,679 --> 00:00:34,399
can you add this to the project

15
00:00:31,279 --> 00:00:37,280
and scurry's off to a meeting guaranteed

16
00:00:34,399 --> 00:00:39,200
that person expects or at least hopes

17
00:00:37,280 --> 00:00:41,680
you'll add the request to the project

18
00:00:39,200 --> 00:00:43,280
without adjusting the schedule or budget

19
00:00:41,680 --> 00:00:46,800
if you do

20
00:00:43,280 --> 00:00:48,079
that's scope creep scope can change for

21
00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:50,000
other reasons

22
00:00:48,079 --> 00:00:52,480
for example the scope might not have

23
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:54,160
been clearly defined up front

24
00:00:52,480 --> 00:00:55,600
suppose the customer assumes you're

25
00:00:54,160 --> 00:00:57,520
familiar with their industry

26
00:00:55,600 --> 00:00:59,120
and doesn't think they have to tell you

27
00:00:57,520 --> 00:01:00,879
everything they need while you're

28
00:00:59,120 --> 00:01:03,280
identifying requirements

29
00:01:00,879 --> 00:01:06,080
then again maybe the customer doesn't

30
00:01:03,280 --> 00:01:08,799
know exactly what they want

31
00:01:06,080 --> 00:01:10,240
the best way to prevent scope creep is

32
00:01:08,799 --> 00:01:13,200
to identify scope

33
00:01:10,240 --> 00:01:14,640
clearly during planning but what can you

34
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:16,880
do if planning is over

35
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:18,640
and the scope is spreading like weeds in

36
00:01:16,880 --> 00:01:21,680
your flowerbed

37
00:01:18,640 --> 00:01:24,640
first reset unrealistic

38
00:01:21,680 --> 00:01:25,439
expectations if the customer is asking

39
00:01:24,640 --> 00:01:28,159
for features

40
00:01:25,439 --> 00:01:30,479
that are clearly out of scope point out

41
00:01:28,159 --> 00:01:32,240
that they aren't in the scope statement

42
00:01:30,479 --> 00:01:34,560
you can talk to the customer about the

43
00:01:32,240 --> 00:01:37,759
schedule and budget changes needed to

44
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:39,520
add to the project scope also

45
00:01:37,759 --> 00:01:41,600
make sure the customer and your team

46
00:01:39,520 --> 00:01:44,880
understand that undocumented

47
00:01:41,600 --> 00:01:47,840
informal changes aren't acceptable

48
00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:49,119
explain that in the future requests must

49
00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:51,920
go through the change

50
00:01:49,119 --> 00:01:53,439
management process that way you're in

51
00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:56,719
control of the scope

52
00:01:53,439 --> 00:01:58,960
even if it's changing if scope wasn't

53
00:01:56,719 --> 00:02:01,439
clearly defined in the first place

54
00:01:58,960 --> 00:02:02,159
work with the customer to renegotiate

55
00:02:01,439 --> 00:02:05,759
the scope

56
00:02:02,159 --> 00:02:06,880
so it is clear if the customer doesn't

57
00:02:05,759 --> 00:02:09,440
know what they want

58
00:02:06,880 --> 00:02:09,920
consider switching to an agile approach

59
00:02:09,440 --> 00:02:11,360
that way

60
00:02:09,920 --> 00:02:13,360
you and the customer will have

61
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:16,720
opportunities to hone the scope

62
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:18,160
over time keeping scope under control

63
00:02:16,720 --> 00:02:21,200
throughout your project is

64
00:02:18,160 --> 00:02:23,120
key to making projects successful i've

65
00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:24,879
given you a list of scope change

66
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:25,760
requests for the hospital scheduling

67
00:02:24,879 --> 00:02:29,040
project

68
00:02:25,760 --> 00:02:32,800
for practice identify which requests are

69
00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:32,800
out of scope
