1
00:00:00,640 --> 00:00:03,120
after you get the go-ahead to plan your

2
00:00:02,480 --> 00:00:05,520
project

3
00:00:03,120 --> 00:00:07,839
the first thing you do is identify the

4
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:11,200
work that has to be done

5
00:00:07,839 --> 00:00:12,719
even small projects can have lots of

6
00:00:11,200 --> 00:00:14,559
tasks

7
00:00:12,719 --> 00:00:16,160
that's why project managers use a

8
00:00:14,559 --> 00:00:19,439
diagram called a

9
00:00:16,160 --> 00:00:22,880
work breakdown structure or wbs

10
00:00:19,439 --> 00:00:25,519
to organize work you use it to divvy up

11
00:00:22,880 --> 00:00:28,240
project work into manageable pieces

12
00:00:25,519 --> 00:00:29,439
so you can plan track and manage your

13
00:00:28,240 --> 00:00:32,320
project

14
00:00:29,439 --> 00:00:32,719
creating a wbs helps manage the project

15
00:00:32,320 --> 00:00:35,840
in

16
00:00:32,719 --> 00:00:36,480
several ways first it's easier to

17
00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:39,840
estimate

18
00:00:36,480 --> 00:00:42,239
time and cost for smaller chunks of work

19
00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:44,800
say the sponsor wants to know how long

20
00:00:42,239 --> 00:00:46,640
the whole project will take

21
00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:48,079
you can't come up with a good answer off

22
00:00:46,640 --> 00:00:50,239
the top of your head

23
00:00:48,079 --> 00:00:52,000
it's a lot easier to think about how

24
00:00:50,239 --> 00:00:53,120
long smaller parts of the project will

25
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:55,199
take

26
00:00:53,120 --> 00:00:56,879
after you estimate the small chunks you

27
00:00:55,199 --> 00:00:59,840
can add them up to get an

28
00:00:56,879 --> 00:01:01,680
estimate for the entire project it's

29
00:00:59,840 --> 00:01:04,640
also easier to assign

30
00:01:01,680 --> 00:01:06,000
work to team members by breaking work

31
00:01:04,640 --> 00:01:08,159
into smaller pieces

32
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:09,360
you'll have built-in checkpoints to

33
00:01:08,159 --> 00:01:12,880
measure progress

34
00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:14,080
on the project a wbs contains two kinds

35
00:01:12,880 --> 00:01:17,360
of tasks

36
00:01:14,080 --> 00:01:20,000
summary tasks and work packages

37
00:01:17,360 --> 00:01:21,360
summary tasks are the higher level tasks

38
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:24,960
that summarize work

39
00:01:21,360 --> 00:01:27,439
in some way summary tasks describe

40
00:01:24,960 --> 00:01:28,159
parts of the project they could

41
00:01:27,439 --> 00:01:31,040
represent

42
00:01:28,159 --> 00:01:34,000
phases or deliverables or even work done

43
00:01:31,040 --> 00:01:36,880
by different groups in your organization

44
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:38,840
in our scheduling project the wbs is

45
00:01:36,880 --> 00:01:41,680
organized by

46
00:01:38,840 --> 00:01:44,640
deliverable how many levels of summary

47
00:01:41,680 --> 00:01:46,799
tasks depends on the size of the project

48
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:47,759
a few levels are enough for a small

49
00:01:46,799 --> 00:01:50,240
project

50
00:01:47,759 --> 00:01:51,280
if a project is large or complex you

51
00:01:50,240 --> 00:01:54,640
might have

52
00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:57,840
several levels of summary tasks

53
00:01:54,640 --> 00:02:00,320
work packages are the lowest level tasks

54
00:01:57,840 --> 00:02:01,119
in the work breakdown structure they

55
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:03,600
spell out

56
00:02:01,119 --> 00:02:05,040
lowest level project deliverables and

57
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:08,080
the detailed work

58
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:08,879
needed to deliver them in the scheduling

59
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:11,280
project

60
00:02:08,879 --> 00:02:12,080
the summary task to configure the system

61
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:14,640
server

62
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:15,520
might have work packages to activate

63
00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:19,360
modules

64
00:02:15,520 --> 00:02:21,280
set options and add software links

65
00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:22,800
breaking your project down into

66
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:26,040
manageable pieces

67
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:29,040
helps you plan and manage your project

68
00:02:26,040 --> 00:02:29,040
effectively
