1
00:00:00,640 --> 00:00:04,480
the project isn't done until the

2
00:00:02,960 --> 00:00:06,080
customer says so

3
00:00:04,480 --> 00:00:08,160
but that doesn't mean they can keep

4
00:00:06,080 --> 00:00:11,120
asking you to do things

5
00:00:08,160 --> 00:00:14,160
during closing you run acceptance tests

6
00:00:11,120 --> 00:00:16,080
to prove that the project is complete

7
00:00:14,160 --> 00:00:17,520
back in planning you fleshed out the

8
00:00:16,080 --> 00:00:19,920
project deliverables

9
00:00:17,520 --> 00:00:22,000
and defined clear and quantifiable

10
00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:24,800
success criteria

11
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:25,920
now it's time to design acceptance tests

12
00:00:24,800 --> 00:00:27,840
to demonstrate

13
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:29,359
whether the deliverables do what they're

14
00:00:27,840 --> 00:00:31,599
supposed to

15
00:00:29,359 --> 00:00:33,120
you also document procedures for running

16
00:00:31,599 --> 00:00:34,880
those tests

17
00:00:33,120 --> 00:00:37,280
let's look at the hospital scheduling

18
00:00:34,880 --> 00:00:37,920
project a first batch of acceptance

19
00:00:37,280 --> 00:00:39,680
tests

20
00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:42,239
might demonstrate that the system is

21
00:00:39,680 --> 00:00:42,800
running and that devices can connect to

22
00:00:42,239 --> 00:00:45,200
it

23
00:00:42,800 --> 00:00:46,719
once those tests are complete you might

24
00:00:45,200 --> 00:00:49,039
run a second batch

25
00:00:46,719 --> 00:00:51,520
to see whether hospital data uploaded

26
00:00:49,039 --> 00:00:53,840
correctly into the new system

27
00:00:51,520 --> 00:00:56,000
after that more tests might show that

28
00:00:53,840 --> 00:00:59,039
the most common scheduling tasks

29
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:00,719
can be completed efficiently when the

30
00:00:59,039 --> 00:01:03,280
acceptance tests are done

31
00:01:00,719 --> 00:01:03,920
hold a brief sign-off meeting to get the

32
00:01:03,280 --> 00:01:06,240
customer

33
00:01:03,920 --> 00:01:07,760
and other key stakeholders to sign the

34
00:01:06,240 --> 00:01:09,360
acceptance document

35
00:01:07,760 --> 00:01:11,200
that means they agree that the

36
00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:14,880
deliverables are complete

37
00:01:11,200 --> 00:01:17,280
and successful congratulations

38
00:01:14,880 --> 00:01:18,240
obtaining customer acceptance is a big

39
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:22,000
milestone

40
00:01:18,240 --> 00:01:24,960
and worthy of a celebration for practice

41
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:26,000
identify existing project documents that

42
00:01:24,960 --> 00:01:28,400
you could use

43
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:32,880
to develop the acceptance tests for the

44
00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:32,880
hospital scheduling project
