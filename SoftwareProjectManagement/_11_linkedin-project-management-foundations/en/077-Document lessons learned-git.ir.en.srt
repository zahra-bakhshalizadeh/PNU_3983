1
00:00:00,640 --> 00:00:06,480
on every project some things go well

2
00:00:03,439 --> 00:00:09,040
and other things could go better don't

3
00:00:06,480 --> 00:00:11,120
let that experience go to waste

4
00:00:09,040 --> 00:00:12,719
by collecting lessons learned you can

5
00:00:11,120 --> 00:00:15,040
repeat your successes

6
00:00:12,719 --> 00:00:16,240
and improve on your less than stellar

7
00:00:15,040 --> 00:00:18,880
performance

8
00:00:16,240 --> 00:00:20,560
let's look at ways to coax this info out

9
00:00:18,880 --> 00:00:22,640
of your team members

10
00:00:20,560 --> 00:00:25,199
then you can document those lessons to

11
00:00:22,640 --> 00:00:28,320
benefit future projects

12
00:00:25,199 --> 00:00:30,560
first schedule time regularly

13
00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:32,079
for lessons learned don't wait until the

14
00:00:30,560 --> 00:00:34,399
end of the project to ask about

15
00:00:32,079 --> 00:00:36,399
lessons learned by then your team

16
00:00:34,399 --> 00:00:37,280
members have already forgotten a lot of

17
00:00:36,399 --> 00:00:39,600
them

18
00:00:37,280 --> 00:00:40,640
one approach is to add lessons learned

19
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:43,280
as a topic

20
00:00:40,640 --> 00:00:44,160
in your status meetings keep your

21
00:00:43,280 --> 00:00:47,280
lessons learned

22
00:00:44,160 --> 00:00:50,160
sessions positive and productive

23
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:52,239
start with what went right ask each

24
00:00:50,160 --> 00:00:53,760
person for a tip or technique that

25
00:00:52,239 --> 00:00:56,079
helped them in their work

26
00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:57,199
like what saved you the most time

27
00:00:56,079 --> 00:01:00,079
recently

28
00:00:57,199 --> 00:01:02,480
or what was the gnarliest challenge you

29
00:01:00,079 --> 00:01:04,720
solved and how did you do it

30
00:01:02,480 --> 00:01:06,799
then move on to lessons learned from

31
00:01:04,720 --> 00:01:09,520
problems people faced

32
00:01:06,799 --> 00:01:10,560
remember to keep things positive for

33
00:01:09,520 --> 00:01:13,200
example

34
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:15,840
what would you do differently next time

35
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:18,240
ask people to talk about themselves

36
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:19,759
that way they don't fall into blaming

37
00:01:18,240 --> 00:01:22,400
others

38
00:01:19,759 --> 00:01:23,840
give people the opportunity to be open

39
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:26,479
and honest

40
00:01:23,840 --> 00:01:28,240
try scheduling meetings without managers

41
00:01:26,479 --> 00:01:31,040
to see if people will share

42
00:01:28,240 --> 00:01:33,119
information more freely you might use an

43
00:01:31,040 --> 00:01:33,680
anonymous method for submitting lessons

44
00:01:33,119 --> 00:01:36,400
learned

45
00:01:33,680 --> 00:01:37,439
like a suggestion box this approach can

46
00:01:36,400 --> 00:01:39,280
be helpful for

47
00:01:37,439 --> 00:01:40,640
sensitive issues or when people are

48
00:01:39,280 --> 00:01:44,560
afraid to admit

49
00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:47,439
mistakes finally document

50
00:01:44,560 --> 00:01:47,920
lessons learned you can add them to your

51
00:01:47,439 --> 00:01:50,159
project

52
00:01:47,920 --> 00:01:52,159
notebook but you can also set up a

53
00:01:50,159 --> 00:01:54,479
knowledge base like a web page with

54
00:01:52,159 --> 00:01:56,560
frequently asked questions

55
00:01:54,479 --> 00:01:58,000
that way everyone in your company can

56
00:01:56,560 --> 00:02:01,280
learn what your team

57
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:03,680
already knows lessons learned

58
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:04,479
give your organization the opportunity

59
00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:07,600
to learn

60
00:02:04,479 --> 00:02:09,440
and grow with each new project assuming

61
00:02:07,600 --> 00:02:11,920
that the hospitals in the consortium

62
00:02:09,440 --> 00:02:12,640
share a collaboration system develop a

63
00:02:11,920 --> 00:02:15,200
plan for

64
00:02:12,640 --> 00:02:16,720
sharing lessons learned among schedulers

65
00:02:15,200 --> 00:02:18,959
and it teams

66
00:02:16,720 --> 00:02:22,959
you can see my take on this plan in the

67
00:02:18,959 --> 00:02:22,959
