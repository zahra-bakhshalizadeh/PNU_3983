00:00:05,730 --> 00:00:11,130
For this challenge, review the hospital organization
chart and the scope statement from the chapter

2
00:00:11,130 --> 00:00:16,560
to exercise files, remember that the project
charter should include information about the

00:00:16,560 --> 00:00:22,750
project managers authority and the support
that the project's sponsor provides. The exercise

4
00:00:22,750 --> 00:00:28,010
files include a challenge that poses several
questions about the project charter for the

5
00:00:28,010 --> 00:00:35,020
Brisbane Hospital Scheduling Project. Take
20 to 30 minutes to answer those questions.

6
00:00:35,020 --> 00:00:39,440
After you've completed the challenge, take
a look at the solution to see what I came

00:00:39,440 --> 00:00:39,860
up with.
