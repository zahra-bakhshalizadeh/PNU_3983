1
00:00:00,799 --> 00:00:05,759
how do projects get started

2
00:00:03,199 --> 00:00:08,400
when someone has a problem to solve or

3
00:00:05,759 --> 00:00:10,080
an opportunity to pursue

4
00:00:08,400 --> 00:00:11,840
we all want our projects to be

5
00:00:10,080 --> 00:00:14,400
successful

6
00:00:11,840 --> 00:00:16,880
organizations want to enjoy the benefits

7
00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:19,119
that those projects produce

8
00:00:16,880 --> 00:00:20,480
and as project managers we look forward

9
00:00:19,119 --> 00:00:22,480
to our next project

10
00:00:20,480 --> 00:00:23,519
with opportunities to learn about new

11
00:00:22,480 --> 00:00:27,279
industries

12
00:00:23,519 --> 00:00:29,679
or manage projects around the world

13
00:00:27,279 --> 00:00:30,480
delivering a project successfully is

14
00:00:29,679 --> 00:00:33,760
more than

15
00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:36,320
writing up and handing out to-do lists

16
00:00:33,760 --> 00:00:37,920
your job as project manager is an

17
00:00:36,320 --> 00:00:40,719
ongoing balancing act

18
00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:43,440
between project scope and the time

19
00:00:40,719 --> 00:00:45,840
resources and budget you've been given

20
00:00:43,440 --> 00:00:46,640
to make things more interesting people

21
00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:50,559
will ask for

22
00:00:46,640 --> 00:00:53,680
changes mid-stream risks will become

23
00:00:50,559 --> 00:00:55,520
real issues and work never goes

24
00:00:53,680 --> 00:00:57,440
according to plan

25
00:00:55,520 --> 00:00:58,879
so you have to continually correct

26
00:00:57,440 --> 00:01:01,840
course pretty much

27
00:00:58,879 --> 00:01:03,120
until the project is done in this

28
00:01:01,840 --> 00:01:05,680
linkedin learning course

29
00:01:03,120 --> 00:01:08,479
we'll use a case study to explore how to

30
00:01:05,680 --> 00:01:10,479
manage projects successfully

31
00:01:08,479 --> 00:01:11,600
we'll look at how to start a project the

32
00:01:10,479 --> 00:01:13,600
right way

33
00:01:11,600 --> 00:01:16,159
and then put together a comprehensive

34
00:01:13,600 --> 00:01:17,759
plan for running it

35
00:01:16,159 --> 00:01:21,520
i'll guide you through keeping your

36
00:01:17,759 --> 00:01:23,280
project on track from start to finish

37
00:01:21,520 --> 00:01:25,040
you'll get a chance to practice what you

38
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:27,680
learn with the exercises

39
00:01:25,040 --> 00:01:30,400
at the end of almost every movie and

40
00:01:27,680 --> 00:01:32,560
with end of chapter challenges

41
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:34,560
with these techniques under your belt

42
00:01:32,560 --> 00:01:35,840
you'll be able to meet stakeholders

43
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:38,479
expectations

44
00:01:35,840 --> 00:01:39,520
and handle the changes that inevitably

45
00:01:38,479 --> 00:01:42,560
arise

46
00:01:39,520 --> 00:01:43,920
