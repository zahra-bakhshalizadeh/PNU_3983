1
00:00:00,560 --> 00:00:05,359
a closeout report is like a final status

2
00:00:03,600 --> 00:00:08,240
report for a project

3
00:00:05,359 --> 00:00:08,639
it sums up the project results and helps

4
00:00:08,240 --> 00:00:11,519
share

5
00:00:08,639 --> 00:00:12,080
what you learned with others like a news

6
00:00:11,519 --> 00:00:13,920
article

7
00:00:12,080 --> 00:00:15,360
start with the highlights what the

8
00:00:13,920 --> 00:00:17,680
project accomplished

9
00:00:15,360 --> 00:00:19,840
and whether it was successful did the

10
00:00:17,680 --> 00:00:23,039
project deliver what it was supposed to

11
00:00:19,840 --> 00:00:26,080
was it on time and within budget if not

12
00:00:23,039 --> 00:00:28,160
what was the main reason why then you

13
00:00:26,080 --> 00:00:29,279
can expand on the project schedule and

14
00:00:28,160 --> 00:00:31,279
cost

15
00:00:29,279 --> 00:00:34,079
when did the project finish if the

16
00:00:31,279 --> 00:00:36,399
project was significantly early or late

17
00:00:34,079 --> 00:00:37,280
include the variances from your original

18
00:00:36,399 --> 00:00:40,800
dates

19
00:00:37,280 --> 00:00:41,520
and the reasons that helps publicize

20
00:00:40,800 --> 00:00:44,719
ways to

21
00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:46,719
improve estimates for future projects

22
00:00:44,719 --> 00:00:47,840
what was the final cost for the whole

23
00:00:46,719 --> 00:00:50,079
project

24
00:00:47,840 --> 00:00:50,960
what did major portions of the project

25
00:00:50,079 --> 00:00:52,719
cost

26
00:00:50,960 --> 00:00:54,000
were there significant variances from

27
00:00:52,719 --> 00:00:55,920
the baseline

28
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:58,399
depending on what the stakeholders want

29
00:00:55,920 --> 00:00:59,440
to know you might include return on

30
00:00:58,399 --> 00:01:02,559
investment and

31
00:00:59,440 --> 00:01:04,400
other financial measures next

32
00:01:02,559 --> 00:01:07,040
include information you want to share

33
00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:10,400
with others like significant changes

34
00:01:07,040 --> 00:01:12,320
issues risks and lessons learned

35
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:13,760
say the project didn't deliver the

36
00:01:12,320 --> 00:01:16,159
entire scope

37
00:01:13,760 --> 00:01:16,880
in the closeout report identify the

38
00:01:16,159 --> 00:01:20,159
scope that

39
00:01:16,880 --> 00:01:21,439
was and wasn't delivered in the hospital

40
00:01:20,159 --> 00:01:24,000
scheduling project

41
00:01:21,439 --> 00:01:25,200
an additional custom software module was

42
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:27,439
added to scope

43
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:29,439
to integrate the scheduling systems and

44
00:01:27,439 --> 00:01:31,920
the accounting system

45
00:01:29,439 --> 00:01:32,880
for risks that occurred describe how you

46
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:36,320
handled them

47
00:01:32,880 --> 00:01:36,799
and the results if risks occurred that

48
00:01:36,320 --> 00:01:38,400
weren't

49
00:01:36,799 --> 00:01:41,200
identified in the original risk

50
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:44,240
management plan point them out so they

51
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:47,119
aren't missed in the future include

52
00:01:44,240 --> 00:01:48,479
significant lessons learned for instance

53
00:01:47,119 --> 00:01:50,799
the scheduling project

54
00:01:48,479 --> 00:01:52,079
showed that vendor procurement takes

55
00:01:50,799 --> 00:01:55,040
more time than was

56
00:01:52,079 --> 00:01:57,200
allocated in this project finally

57
00:01:55,040 --> 00:02:00,079
include a summary of the effectiveness

58
00:01:57,200 --> 00:02:02,079
of your project management practices

59
00:02:00,079 --> 00:02:03,360
like lessons learned you can describe

60
00:02:02,079 --> 00:02:05,520
what worked well

61
00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:07,520
and how you would plan and manage

62
00:02:05,520 --> 00:02:10,319
differently in the future

63
00:02:07,520 --> 00:02:11,440
the project closeout report sums up what

64
00:02:10,319 --> 00:02:14,000
the project did

65
00:02:11,440 --> 00:02:16,720
and how it did it because you'll create

66
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:19,120
one of these at the end of every project

67
00:02:16,720 --> 00:02:21,120
why not practice by setting up your own

68
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:23,280
closeout report template

69
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:25,040
you'll find a sample closeout report for

70
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:29,280
the hospital scheduling project

71
00:02:25,040 --> 00:02:29,280
in the exercise files
