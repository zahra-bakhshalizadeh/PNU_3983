1
00:00:00,799 --> 00:00:07,040
with earned value analysis a project

2
00:00:03,760 --> 00:00:09,440
earns value by completing work

3
00:00:07,040 --> 00:00:11,920
it helps you evaluate project schedule

4
00:00:09,440 --> 00:00:15,280
and cost performance

5
00:00:11,920 --> 00:00:17,760
government projects typically require it

6
00:00:15,280 --> 00:00:19,520
earned value analysis is helpful because

7
00:00:17,760 --> 00:00:22,880
project measures can be

8
00:00:19,520 --> 00:00:24,880
deceiving say fifty percent of your

9
00:00:22,880 --> 00:00:26,880
project's duration has passed

10
00:00:24,880 --> 00:00:28,480
and fifty percent of the budget has been

11
00:00:26,880 --> 00:00:31,359
spent

12
00:00:28,480 --> 00:00:32,800
sounds like things are right on track

13
00:00:31,359 --> 00:00:34,800
but if only 25

14
00:00:32,800 --> 00:00:36,399
of the work is complete there's a

15
00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:38,879
problem

16
00:00:36,399 --> 00:00:39,520
you have to finish 75 percent of the

17
00:00:38,879 --> 00:00:41,920
work

18
00:00:39,520 --> 00:00:43,520
with only 50 percent of the time and

19
00:00:41,920 --> 00:00:45,840
money left

20
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:48,719
i don't know about you but i would not

21
00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:51,280
count on that happening

22
00:00:48,719 --> 00:00:51,920
earn value analysis uncovers problems

23
00:00:51,280 --> 00:00:53,920
like these

24
00:00:51,920 --> 00:00:56,079
because it looks at your schedule and

25
00:00:53,920 --> 00:01:00,399
budget in monetary terms

26
00:00:56,079 --> 00:01:01,760
over time of course costs are already

27
00:01:00,399 --> 00:01:03,840
money based

28
00:01:01,760 --> 00:01:06,479
but you also measure work in terms of

29
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:09,840
money by calculating how much it costs

30
00:01:06,479 --> 00:01:12,400
for people to perform the work

31
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:13,280
earned value analysis is based on three

32
00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:15,439
measures

33
00:01:13,280 --> 00:01:17,040
calculated through the project status

34
00:01:15,439 --> 00:01:20,159
date

35
00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:22,479
first you measure planned value

36
00:01:20,159 --> 00:01:23,840
that's how much you plan to spend to

37
00:01:22,479 --> 00:01:26,560
complete the work

38
00:01:23,840 --> 00:01:27,600
scheduled through the status date it's

39
00:01:26,560 --> 00:01:31,360
also called

40
00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:33,439
budgeted cost of work scheduled

41
00:01:31,360 --> 00:01:35,360
say your baseline shows five thousand

42
00:01:33,439 --> 00:01:38,840
dollars spent on a task

43
00:01:35,360 --> 00:01:41,040
through may 12th that's the planned

44
00:01:38,840 --> 00:01:43,520
value

45
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:44,799
second earned value is the amount of

46
00:01:43,520 --> 00:01:47,680
money you've earned by

47
00:01:44,799 --> 00:01:51,280
completing work his other name is

48
00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:54,399
budgeted cost of work performed

49
00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:55,200
say the team worked 30 hours through may

50
00:01:54,399 --> 00:01:57,360
12th

51
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:58,479
and the planned labor cost for those

52
00:01:57,360 --> 00:02:01,119
hours is three

53
00:01:58,479 --> 00:02:02,079
thousand dollars through the may 12th

54
00:02:01,119 --> 00:02:03,759
status date

55
00:02:02,079 --> 00:02:06,479
the project has earned three thousand

56
00:02:03,759 --> 00:02:09,360
dollars by completing that work

57
00:02:06,479 --> 00:02:11,599
the third measure is the actual cost for

58
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:13,840
the completed work

59
00:02:11,599 --> 00:02:14,720
suppose you brought in a more expensive

60
00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:19,440
resource

61
00:02:14,720 --> 00:02:23,360
so the labor cost is actually 3 500

62
00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:24,000
that's your actual cost a graph of these

63
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:26,239
values

64
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:28,400
helps you see whether your project is on

65
00:02:26,239 --> 00:02:31,680
schedule and within budget

66
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:34,000
here's how you read the graph time is

67
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:37,280
along the horizontal axis

68
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:40,000
and cost is on the vertical axis

69
00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:41,840
you want to see earned value above

70
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:44,160
planned value

71
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:45,840
that means you've completed more work

72
00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:48,480
than you planned

73
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:50,720
in other words the task or project is

74
00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:54,080
ahead of schedule

75
00:02:50,720 --> 00:02:57,120
you also want to see actual cost below

76
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:57,599
earned value that means you've actually

77
00:02:57,120 --> 00:02:59,440
spent

78
00:02:57,599 --> 00:03:01,440
less for the work you've completed than

79
00:02:59,440 --> 00:03:04,159
you planned

80
00:03:01,440 --> 00:03:05,120
in this example earned value is below

81
00:03:04,159 --> 00:03:08,239
plan value

82
00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:12,080
so the project is behind schedule

83
00:03:08,239 --> 00:03:14,400
darn it on the other hand actual cost is

84
00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:17,760
below earned value so the project is

85
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:20,239
under budget that's good news

86
00:03:17,760 --> 00:03:21,760
earned value analysis has more measures

87
00:03:20,239 --> 00:03:22,879
for evaluating your project's

88
00:03:21,760 --> 00:03:24,959
performance

89
00:03:22,879 --> 00:03:26,239
if you're interested in earned value

90
00:03:24,959 --> 00:03:29,840
research this tool

91
00:03:26,239 --> 00:03:31,920
in more detail in the meantime

92
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:33,599
there is an earned value graph in the

93
00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:35,840
exercise files

94
00:03:33,599 --> 00:03:37,200
for practice determine whether the

95
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:40,480
project shown in the graph

96
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:44,959
is ahead of or behind schedule and

97
00:03:40,480 --> 00:03:44,959
over or under budget
