1
00:00:00,560 --> 00:00:06,569
Now that you have the project goal objectives
and strategy identified, it's time to describe

2
00:00:06,569 --> 00:00:14,400
specifically what the project must deliver,
known as requirements. Getting requirements

3
00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:21,509
right is crucial if you don't identify a project's
true requirements, the stakeholders won't

4
00:00:21,509 --> 00:00:27,849
be satisfied with the project results. And
if you include requirements that aren't necessary,

5
00:00:27,849 --> 00:00:33,290
the project will probably take longer and
cost more than it should. For the hospital

6
00:00:33,290 --> 00:00:41,550
scheduling project, one objective is rescheduling
procedures decreased by 75 percent. One requirement

7
00:00:41,550 --> 00:00:49,500
for the scheduling system might be simultaneously
schedule staff, equipment and facilities required

8
00:00:49,500 --> 00:00:56,150
for a procedure. Another requirement could
be searched for next time slot that all selected

9
00:00:56,150 --> 00:01:03,570
items are available. These requirements are
both necessary and specific, you can expand

10
00:01:03,570 --> 00:01:11,280
them to provide even more detail. Gathering
requirements can be challenging, stakeholders

11
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:19,119
might describe their requirements incorrectly
or provide inconsistent or contradictory requirements,

12
00:01:19,119 --> 00:01:25,499
they might leave out requirements they need
or include nice to haves. Sometimes people

13
00:01:25,499 --> 00:01:32,320
who aren't stakeholders try to squeeze their
requirements into your project. In addition,

14
00:01:32,320 --> 00:01:38,250
stakeholders often balk at committing the
time it takes to define requirements. There

15
00:01:38,250 --> 00:01:45,799
are several techniques for gathering requirements.
Interviews are one approach. The key is to

16
00:01:45,799 --> 00:01:51,540
interview the right people and come with the
list of questions. If your project involves

17
00:01:51,540 --> 00:01:57,880
several groups, try brainstorming sessions
or focus groups with representatives from

18
00:01:57,880 --> 00:02:03,630
each group to discuss their requirements for
the project. These meetings may help you obtain

19
00:02:03,630 --> 00:02:09,500
Buy-In from the departments that attend.
Another approach is to observe how people

20
00:02:09,500 --> 00:02:15,390
work. In other words, watch what people do
in their day to day activities to validate

21
00:02:15,390 --> 00:02:20,540
the requirements. Write them up and review
them with the workers. Questionnaires and

22
00:02:20,540 --> 00:02:26,459
surveys are another way to get requirements
from stakeholders, build these documents carefully

23
00:02:26,459 --> 00:02:32,939
so the questions don't influence the answers
people provide. If documentation or results

24
00:02:32,939 --> 00:02:40,250
already exist, you can identify requirements
by analyzing documents or reverse engineering

25
00:02:40,250 --> 00:02:47,450
products. Next, you need to analyze the initial
requirements to make sure they make sense,

26
00:02:47,450 --> 00:02:52,591
you might discover that you don't have all
the information you need or that requirements

27
00:02:52,591 --> 00:02:59,810
are inconsistent or duplicated. After you
do some analysis, go back to your stakeholders

28
00:02:59,810 --> 00:03:06,659
to ask more questions and clarify their answers,
don't worry, it can take several rounds to

29
00:03:06,659 --> 00:03:14,409
get a project's real requirements. Eventually,
the requirements will start to make sense

30
00:03:14,409 --> 00:03:20,080
when that happens, it's time to document those
requirements to ensure that the requirements

31
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:25,480
are correct and everyone understands them,
it's important to write them in a clear, easy

32
00:03:25,480 --> 00:03:31,909
to understand language organizing requirements
into related categories can help you eliminate

33
00:03:31,909 --> 00:03:38,799
duplication and conflicts. Requirements provide
detailed descriptions of what a project is

34
00:03:38,799 --> 00:03:45,299
supposed to deliver. So it's important to
get them right for practice, identify the

35
00:03:45,299 --> 00:03:51,219
techniques you might choose to gather requirements
for the hospital scheduling project and how

36
00:03:51,219 --> 00:03:53,410
you would address any challenges.
