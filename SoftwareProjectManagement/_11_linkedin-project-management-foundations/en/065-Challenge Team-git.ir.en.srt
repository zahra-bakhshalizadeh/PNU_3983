[Music]

2
00:00:05,680 --> 00:00:09,200
in this challenge

3
00:00:06,960 --> 00:00:10,400
tension is increasing between your

4
00:00:09,200 --> 00:00:12,559
project team

5
00:00:10,400 --> 00:00:13,440
and the vendor team members who supply

6
00:00:12,559 --> 00:00:15,839
expertise

7
00:00:13,440 --> 00:00:16,800
on the cancer wards scheduling system

8
00:00:15,839 --> 00:00:19,359
the friction

9
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:20,720
seems to be the cause of the vendor team

10
00:00:19,359 --> 00:00:22,960
missing the deadline

11
00:00:20,720 --> 00:00:25,119
for delivering specifications for the

12
00:00:22,960 --> 00:00:26,400
connection between the two scheduling

13
00:00:25,119 --> 00:00:28,560
systems

14
00:00:26,400 --> 00:00:29,599
this missed deadline will impact your

15
00:00:28,560 --> 00:00:31,840
project deadline

16
00:00:29,599 --> 00:00:33,920
because there is almost no slack in this

17
00:00:31,840 --> 00:00:37,520
part of your schedule

18
00:00:33,920 --> 00:00:38,320
you need to intervene what actions

19
00:00:37,520 --> 00:00:40,719
should you take

20
00:00:38,320 --> 00:00:41,760
to address this team relationship

21
00:00:40,719 --> 00:00:44,800
problem

22
00:00:41,760 --> 00:00:47,840
take about 10 minutes to think about it

23
00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:49,960
after you plan your response look at my

24
00:00:47,840 --> 00:00:52,960
take on resolving this

25
00:00:49,960 --> 00:00:52,960
issue
