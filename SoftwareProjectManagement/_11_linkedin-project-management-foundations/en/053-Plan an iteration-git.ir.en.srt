1
00:00:00,719 --> 00:00:05,279
with an agile project you still

2
00:00:03,040 --> 00:00:07,759
plan things before you dive into the

3
00:00:05,279 --> 00:00:09,760
work the speculate stage is when the

4
00:00:07,759 --> 00:00:11,280
business and technical teams identify

5
00:00:09,760 --> 00:00:14,400
the features to include

6
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:16,800
in the current iteration a feature

7
00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:17,520
is a small function or deliverable that

8
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:20,480
addresses

9
00:00:17,520 --> 00:00:21,920
a business need in the hospital project

10
00:00:20,480 --> 00:00:24,800
scheduling functions

11
00:00:21,920 --> 00:00:25,840
user documentation and training could be

12
00:00:24,800 --> 00:00:28,720
features

13
00:00:25,840 --> 00:00:30,400
the typical naming convention is action

14
00:00:28,720 --> 00:00:33,200
followed by result

15
00:00:30,400 --> 00:00:34,640
for example find next available

16
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:38,000
appointment time

17
00:00:34,640 --> 00:00:40,640
or change procedure room

18
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:41,200
the first iteration speculate stage

19
00:00:40,640 --> 00:00:44,239
takes

20
00:00:41,200 --> 00:00:46,480
a little longer than the following ones

21
00:00:44,239 --> 00:00:48,160
that's because you have to identify and

22
00:00:46,480 --> 00:00:51,120
estimate all the features

23
00:00:48,160 --> 00:00:52,480
for the project which is called the

24
00:00:51,120 --> 00:00:54,719
backlog

25
00:00:52,480 --> 00:00:55,520
one way to build the backlog is to write

26
00:00:54,719 --> 00:00:58,559
each feature

27
00:00:55,520 --> 00:01:00,000
on a sticky note or index card if your

28
00:00:58,559 --> 00:01:02,320
organization uses an

29
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:03,680
agile collaboration tool you can add

30
00:01:02,320 --> 00:01:05,680
features there

31
00:01:03,680 --> 00:01:08,000
when the feature list is complete the

32
00:01:05,680 --> 00:01:08,720
business and technical teams review the

33
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:11,920
features

34
00:01:08,720 --> 00:01:14,240
and prioritize them the business team

35
00:01:11,920 --> 00:01:15,759
prioritizes from a functionality

36
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:18,159
perspective

37
00:01:15,759 --> 00:01:20,320
the technical team considers whether it

38
00:01:18,159 --> 00:01:23,840
makes more sense to build features

39
00:01:20,320 --> 00:01:26,000
in a specific order don't worry if the

40
00:01:23,840 --> 00:01:29,119
business folks identify new features

41
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:30,320
or ask questions about existing ones the

42
00:01:29,119 --> 00:01:33,439
agile approach can

43
00:01:30,320 --> 00:01:34,320
take that in stride worst case if the

44
00:01:33,439 --> 00:01:37,600
list gets

45
00:01:34,320 --> 00:01:38,560
really long you can talk about features

46
00:01:37,600 --> 00:01:41,200
to push to a

47
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:42,399
future project the business and

48
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:44,880
technical team members

49
00:01:42,399 --> 00:01:47,600
also work together to develop estimates

50
00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:49,680
for all features in the project

51
00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:51,200
once the prioritized feature list is

52
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:54,880
approved by the customer

53
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:58,320
or sponsor you can create the iteration

54
00:01:54,880 --> 00:02:01,280
milestone and release plan this plan

55
00:01:58,320 --> 00:02:03,280
outlines all the features when they're

56
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:05,520
scheduled in the iterations

57
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:07,119
and when they'll be implemented in the

58
00:02:05,520 --> 00:02:09,119
organization

59
00:02:07,119 --> 00:02:12,800
and you're ready to start the explore

60
00:02:09,119 --> 00:02:16,080
stage of the first iteration

61
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:19,040
time passes and like any project an

62
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:20,480
agile project doesn't necessarily follow

63
00:02:19,040 --> 00:02:23,360
your plan

64
00:02:20,480 --> 00:02:24,080
each time you start another speculate

65
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:27,360
stage

66
00:02:24,080 --> 00:02:30,720
you have to re-estimate re-evaluate

67
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:34,000
and re-prioritize the features to decide

68
00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:36,480
which ones to include in the iteration

69
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:37,040
like features that weren't completed and

70
00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:39,840
are now

71
00:02:37,040 --> 00:02:41,840
back in the backlog or new features that

72
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:43,760
were identified since the original

73
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:45,920
backlog was built

74
00:02:43,760 --> 00:02:48,640
and the next features in the backlog

75
00:02:45,920 --> 00:02:51,840
that you want to include

76
00:02:48,640 --> 00:02:54,640
the speculate stage doesn't take long

77
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:56,720
if your iterations are three weeks long

78
00:02:54,640 --> 00:03:00,000
you might spend a couple of days

79
00:02:56,720 --> 00:03:02,560
in the speculate stage you start

80
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:03,280
each iteration by planning what will be

81
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:06,000
done

82
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:07,200
for practice use the backlog in the

83
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:12,879
exercise files

84
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:12,879
to build a plan for the next iteration
