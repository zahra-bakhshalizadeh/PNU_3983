1
00:00:00,719 --> 00:00:04,319
the two questions you get hit with most

2
00:00:03,040 --> 00:00:07,200
often about a project

3
00:00:04,319 --> 00:00:09,440
are how much time will it take and how

4
00:00:07,200 --> 00:00:11,920
much will it cost

5
00:00:09,440 --> 00:00:13,759
estimating accurately matters because

6
00:00:11,920 --> 00:00:16,560
your estimates could determine whether

7
00:00:13,759 --> 00:00:19,520
it makes sense to run the project

8
00:00:16,560 --> 00:00:21,600
you start by estimating time because it

9
00:00:19,520 --> 00:00:25,519
affects both the project's schedule

10
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:26,800
and cost you also estimate costs that

11
00:00:25,519 --> 00:00:29,599
aren't time based

12
00:00:26,800 --> 00:00:31,599
like materials and ancillary costs like

13
00:00:29,599 --> 00:00:33,440
travel

14
00:00:31,599 --> 00:00:35,280
during initiating and planning you might

15
00:00:33,440 --> 00:00:36,000
work with a core planning team to

16
00:00:35,280 --> 00:00:39,120
develop

17
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:40,079
initial estimates during project

18
00:00:39,120 --> 00:00:42,079
execution

19
00:00:40,079 --> 00:00:44,879
you can get more accurate estimates from

20
00:00:42,079 --> 00:00:47,520
the people assigned to tasks

21
00:00:44,879 --> 00:00:48,000
they understand what has to be done and

22
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:49,840
know

23
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:51,520
how long it will take based on their

24
00:00:49,840 --> 00:00:54,000
experience

25
00:00:51,520 --> 00:00:55,039
plus they're usually motivated to live

26
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:58,399
up to the estimates

27
00:00:55,039 --> 00:00:58,960
they provide estimates don't have to be

28
00:00:58,399 --> 00:01:01,760
perfect

29
00:00:58,960 --> 00:01:02,000
right off the bat for project selection

30
00:01:01,760 --> 00:01:05,199
an

31
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:06,479
estimate that's plus or minus 75 might

32
00:01:05,199 --> 00:01:08,000
be good enough

33
00:01:06,479 --> 00:01:10,720
as you learn more about the project

34
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:11,600
during planning your estimates grow more

35
00:01:10,720 --> 00:01:16,080
accurate

36
00:01:11,600 --> 00:01:17,920
ideally to plus or minus 10 percent

37
00:01:16,080 --> 00:01:19,840
there are several techniques you can use

38
00:01:17,920 --> 00:01:21,840
for estimating

39
00:01:19,840 --> 00:01:23,280
if you have similar projects that are

40
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:25,439
already complete

41
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:26,799
use them as a foundation for your

42
00:01:25,439 --> 00:01:29,280
project estimate

43
00:01:26,799 --> 00:01:31,759
with parametric models you calculate

44
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:33,439
work and cost based on some measure

45
00:01:31,759 --> 00:01:35,920
like the number of square feet for

46
00:01:33,439 --> 00:01:36,799
construction this technique works when

47
00:01:35,920 --> 00:01:40,400
you have data

48
00:01:36,799 --> 00:01:42,799
from many similar projects

49
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:45,040
if a project represents uncharted

50
00:01:42,799 --> 00:01:47,119
territory for your organization

51
00:01:45,040 --> 00:01:48,720
consider bringing in experts who are

52
00:01:47,119 --> 00:01:51,759
familiar with the work

53
00:01:48,720 --> 00:01:52,960
like consultants or vendors the delphi

54
00:01:51,759 --> 00:01:56,000
technique counts on

55
00:01:52,960 --> 00:01:59,119
several heads being better than one

56
00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:02,479
first you ask several experts to produce

57
00:01:59,119 --> 00:02:04,719
estimates independent of one another

58
00:02:02,479 --> 00:02:07,680
you share the results with the group

59
00:02:04,719 --> 00:02:09,599
keeping the estimates anonymous

60
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:11,039
you keep the estimates anonymous because

61
00:02:09,599 --> 00:02:13,120
you don't want anyone to be

62
00:02:11,039 --> 00:02:16,319
influenced by the reputation or

63
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:20,400
authority of a co-expert

64
00:02:16,319 --> 00:02:22,879
you then ask everyone to estimate again

65
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:23,760
repeat this step a few more times and

66
00:02:22,879 --> 00:02:26,560
then use the

67
00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:29,599
average of the last round as your final

68
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:32,239
estimated value

69
00:02:29,599 --> 00:02:35,120
for large projects or rough estimates

70
00:02:32,239 --> 00:02:38,160
top-down estimating works well

71
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:40,000
you estimate phases or major components

72
00:02:38,160 --> 00:02:41,200
and then break those estimates into

73
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:45,120
smaller pieces

74
00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:47,280
until you get to individual tasks

75
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:49,040
estimating from the bottom up means you

76
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:50,959
estimate each task

77
00:02:49,040 --> 00:02:54,319
and then add them up until you have the

78
00:02:50,959 --> 00:02:56,400
estimate for the entire project

79
00:02:54,319 --> 00:02:58,720
you can also start with a top down

80
00:02:56,400 --> 00:02:59,280
estimate and then revise it by working

81
00:02:58,720 --> 00:03:02,800
your way

82
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:05,200
back up from the bottom to the top

83
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:07,360
the project schedule and cost hinge on

84
00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:07,760
your estimates so it's important to make

85
00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:11,599
them

86
00:03:07,760 --> 00:03:13,200
as accurate as possible for practice

87
00:03:11,599 --> 00:03:14,720
based on what you know about the

88
00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:17,599
hospital scheduling project

89
00:03:14,720 --> 00:03:18,720
so far which estimating technique would

90
00:03:17,599 --> 00:03:21,040
you choose

91
00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:24,400
and how accurate an estimate would you

92
00:03:21,040 --> 00:03:24,400
strive for
