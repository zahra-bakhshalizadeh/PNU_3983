1
00:00:00,880 --> 00:00:05,600
meetings chew up time and energy

2
00:00:03,199 --> 00:00:06,879
that people could be using to get things

3
00:00:05,600 --> 00:00:08,639
done

4
00:00:06,879 --> 00:00:10,559
and because meetings include several

5
00:00:08,639 --> 00:00:13,840
people they cost more than

6
00:00:10,559 --> 00:00:14,559
other work but sometimes they're the

7
00:00:13,840 --> 00:00:18,080
best way

8
00:00:14,559 --> 00:00:18,960
to work and communicate if you hold a

9
00:00:18,080 --> 00:00:21,680
meeting

10
00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:22,640
make it count the first step to a

11
00:00:21,680 --> 00:00:24,480
productive meeting

12
00:00:22,640 --> 00:00:26,400
is to know what you're trying to

13
00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:28,480
accomplish

14
00:00:26,400 --> 00:00:30,240
identify the purpose of the meeting and

15
00:00:28,480 --> 00:00:32,480
the results you need

16
00:00:30,240 --> 00:00:34,640
like approval to move forward or to

17
00:00:32,480 --> 00:00:37,840
resolve an issue

18
00:00:34,640 --> 00:00:39,120
create an agenda that way you can make

19
00:00:37,840 --> 00:00:42,399
sure to cover

20
00:00:39,120 --> 00:00:44,960
every item you can keep discussions

21
00:00:42,399 --> 00:00:46,800
on topic and you'll have a fighting

22
00:00:44,960 --> 00:00:50,239
chance to finish your meeting

23
00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:52,239
on time on the agenda list the

24
00:00:50,239 --> 00:00:54,320
discussion topics

25
00:00:52,239 --> 00:00:57,280
don't forget to include your time

26
00:00:54,320 --> 00:00:59,680
estimate for each topic

27
00:00:57,280 --> 00:01:02,879
the more people you have in a meeting

28
00:00:59,680 --> 00:01:05,280
the harder it is to get things done

29
00:01:02,879 --> 00:01:07,840
that's why the third step is to limit

30
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:10,400
the attendees to the people you need

31
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:13,680
to accomplish your goal also give

32
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:15,439
attendees a chance to prepare

33
00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:17,840
schedule the meeting when it works for

34
00:01:15,439 --> 00:01:18,720
them and send the meeting invitation and

35
00:01:17,840 --> 00:01:21,680
materials

36
00:01:18,720 --> 00:01:24,880
ahead of time for example if you want

37
00:01:21,680 --> 00:01:26,799
stakeholders to approve a revised plan

38
00:01:24,880 --> 00:01:28,960
send the meeting request and the plan

39
00:01:26,799 --> 00:01:32,560
before the meeting

40
00:01:28,960 --> 00:01:35,520
start and finish meetings on time

41
00:01:32,560 --> 00:01:36,799
even if all attendees aren't there be

42
00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:39,680
strong

43
00:01:36,799 --> 00:01:40,000
don't backtrack when people show up late

44
00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:43,200
that

45
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:45,759
just reinforces their rude behavior

46
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:48,960
facilitate the meeting to keep everyone

47
00:01:45,759 --> 00:01:51,680
focused on the meeting's objectives

48
00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:52,960
as project manager you have lots to do

49
00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:56,799
in a meeting

50
00:01:52,960 --> 00:01:58,719
ask someone else to be the facilitator

51
00:01:56,799 --> 00:02:00,640
the facilitator kicks off the meeting

52
00:01:58,719 --> 00:02:02,880
with a brief introduction

53
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:04,799
the purpose of the meeting the agenda

54
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:08,640
topics the attendees

55
00:02:04,799 --> 00:02:10,800
and the ground rules for interaction

56
00:02:08,640 --> 00:02:12,480
the facilitator can coax people to

57
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:14,879
participate

58
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:15,520
or if the discussion starts to go off

59
00:02:14,879 --> 00:02:18,640
track

60
00:02:15,520 --> 00:02:19,520
they can wrangle it back on topic for

61
00:02:18,640 --> 00:02:21,680
example

62
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:23,760
by adding a topic to the parking lot to

63
00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:28,080
be handled later

64
00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:30,720
finally take good meeting notes

65
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:31,680
how else will you remember decisions

66
00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:34,720
action items

67
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:36,959
and who's responsible for them

68
00:02:34,720 --> 00:02:40,400
during the meeting someone can document

69
00:02:36,959 --> 00:02:43,120
items on a whiteboard or a flip chart

70
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:44,959
if possible appoint someone else to be

71
00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:47,040
the scribe

72
00:02:44,959 --> 00:02:48,000
after the meeting you can edit the notes

73
00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:50,879
to emphasize

74
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:51,280
action items who's responsible for them

75
00:02:50,879 --> 00:02:55,040
and

76
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:56,080
when they're due distribute the notes to

77
00:02:55,040 --> 00:02:59,120
attendees and

78
00:02:56,080 --> 00:03:01,440
anyone else who needs to know

79
00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:02,959
if you run effective meetings your

80
00:03:01,440 --> 00:03:05,599
projects will run

81
00:03:02,959 --> 00:03:08,560
more smoothly and you're sure to win

82
00:03:05,599 --> 00:03:12,159
popularity contests at work

83
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:14,000
give yourself a head start for practice

84
00:03:12,159 --> 00:03:19,200
create a checklist of things to do

85
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:19,200
before you hold a meeting
