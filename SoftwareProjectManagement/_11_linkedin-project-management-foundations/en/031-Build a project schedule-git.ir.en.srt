A 
WB US identifies the work needed to complete
a project but it doesn't tell you how long



2
2
00:00:07,340 --> 00:00:10,640

the work will take or
when it can be performed



3
3
00:00:11,120 --> 00:00:18,200 

To do that you need to turn your list of
tasks into a schedule first put the tasks into


4



4

4
00:00:18,200 --> 00:00:24,920

the right sequence you add dependencies or links
to tasks to identify which tasks have to

5




5
00:00:24,920 --> 00:00:30,470

finish before other tasks can start which
tasks finish at the same time.


6



6
00:00:30,920 --> 00:00:37,110
 
And so on. For example the task
build specs has to finish before.

7



7
00:00:37,140 --> 00:00:40,280

Review specs can start likewise.

8



8
00:00:40,370 --> 00:00:46,760

Review specs has to finish before approved specs
can start we'll look at dependencies in



9
9
00:00:46,760 --> 00:00:48,470

detail later in the course.


10



10
00:00:49,070 --> 00:00:57,590

For now the most common dependency type is finish
to start next you add the time you



11
11
00:00:57,590 --> 00:01:04,340

estimate each task will take time estimates and
task sequence help determine how long the

12



12
00:01:04,340 --> 00:01:12,290

entire project will take third you assign the
people on your project team to tasks with



13
13
00:01:12,290 --> 00:01:15,290

the estimated time and people
assigned to do the work.

14



14
00:01:15,350 --> 00:01:18,410

You can calculate the task duration.



15
15
00:01:19,100 --> 00:01:24,740

Finally take into account other constraints
like deadlines and when resources are

16
00:

16
01:24,740 --> 00:01:31,280

available. If your initial schedule doesn't work you
can tweak it in various ways whether



17
17
00:01:31,280 --> 00:01:38,340

you're trying to shorten the schedule cut
costs or even out people's workloads the

1

18
8
00:01:38,340 --> 00:01:42,750

schedule is one of the most
important aspects of your project.


19



19
00:01:43,170 --> 00:01:48,600

It tells you how long the project will last and
when you need the people who will do the

20
00:

20
01:48,600 --> 00:01:48,930

work.
