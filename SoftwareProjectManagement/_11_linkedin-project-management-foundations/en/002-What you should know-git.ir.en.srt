1
00:00:00,799 --> 00:00:04,799
you don't need to know anything about

2
00:00:02,639 --> 00:00:06,080
project management before you start this

3
00:00:04,799 --> 00:00:08,160
course

4
00:00:06,080 --> 00:00:10,240
it works either as an introduction to

5
00:00:08,160 --> 00:00:12,320
project management for beginners

6
00:00:10,240 --> 00:00:14,559
or a refresher if you've been managing

7
00:00:12,320 --> 00:00:16,320
projects for a while

8
00:00:14,559 --> 00:00:18,080
in this course we're going to follow a

9
00:00:16,320 --> 00:00:19,439
project through the project management

10
00:00:18,080 --> 00:00:21,279
life cycle

11
00:00:19,439 --> 00:00:23,600
so for the next few hours you're going

12
00:00:21,279 --> 00:00:25,519
to be a project manager for the brisland

13
00:00:23,600 --> 00:00:28,080
regional hospital

14
00:00:25,519 --> 00:00:28,960
the hospital is adding a new cancer wing

15
00:00:28,080 --> 00:00:31,439
and improving

16
00:00:28,960 --> 00:00:33,680
its facilities thanks to government

17
00:00:31,439 --> 00:00:35,680
grants and generous donations from

18
00:00:33,680 --> 00:00:37,840
several donors

19
00:00:35,680 --> 00:00:38,879
you'll be managing a project to replace

20
00:00:37,840 --> 00:00:41,360
the system and

21
00:00:38,879 --> 00:00:44,000
processes for scheduling patients into

22
00:00:41,360 --> 00:00:46,239
rooms throughout the hospital

23
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:47,760
the goal is to improve the hospital

24
00:00:46,239 --> 00:00:51,520
scheduling capability

25
00:00:47,760 --> 00:00:53,680
and maximize the use of facilities

26
00:00:51,520 --> 00:00:55,120
a more complete description of the case

27
00:00:53,680 --> 00:00:59,039
study is available

28
00:00:55,120 --> 00:00:59,039
in the exercise files
