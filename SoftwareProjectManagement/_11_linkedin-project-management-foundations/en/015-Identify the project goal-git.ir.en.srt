1
00:00:00,799 --> 00:00:06,080
the first step toward project success

2
00:00:03,360 --> 00:00:07,680
is finding out what the customer really

3
00:00:06,080 --> 00:00:09,920
wants

4
00:00:07,680 --> 00:00:11,840
the project goal is the end result that

5
00:00:09,920 --> 00:00:15,200
the project wants the customer

6
00:00:11,840 --> 00:00:16,400
to deliver a goal is something like a

7
00:00:15,200 --> 00:00:20,000
problem to solve

8
00:00:16,400 --> 00:00:22,800
or an opportunity to take advantage of

9
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:23,600
it drives everything that happens in the

10
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:25,359
project

11
00:00:23,600 --> 00:00:27,119
so you want to make sure you've got it

12
00:00:25,359 --> 00:00:29,039
right

13
00:00:27,119 --> 00:00:31,119
you start by putting together a problem

14
00:00:29,039 --> 00:00:33,680
statement that clearly defines the

15
00:00:31,119 --> 00:00:35,440
problem or opportunity

16
00:00:33,680 --> 00:00:36,719
it doesn't have to be a long-winded

17
00:00:35,440 --> 00:00:39,680
affair

18
00:00:36,719 --> 00:00:41,040
if you can fit it into one sentence all

19
00:00:39,680 --> 00:00:42,960
the better

20
00:00:41,040 --> 00:00:44,079
developing a problem statement can be

21
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:48,640
challenging because

22
00:00:44,079 --> 00:00:51,360
people often jump straight to solutions

23
00:00:48,640 --> 00:00:54,239
solutions describe the end result not

24
00:00:51,360 --> 00:00:57,760
the initial motivation

25
00:00:54,239 --> 00:00:59,600
in the hospital project suppose the coo

26
00:00:57,760 --> 00:01:01,920
tells you that the hospital wants to

27
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:04,720
implement a new scheduling system

28
00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:06,479
that's an end result one way to

29
00:01:04,720 --> 00:01:08,560
backtrack from a solution to the

30
00:01:06,479 --> 00:01:12,000
original problem or opportunity

31
00:01:08,560 --> 00:01:15,520
is to ask why why do we need

32
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:16,799
a new scheduling system don't be afraid

33
00:01:15,520 --> 00:01:20,560
to ask why

34
00:01:16,799 --> 00:01:22,640
more than once you can use the answers

35
00:01:20,560 --> 00:01:25,439
to get to the bottom of the problem

36
00:01:22,640 --> 00:01:27,119
or even uncover more specific objectives

37
00:01:25,439 --> 00:01:30,640
for the project

38
00:01:27,119 --> 00:01:34,079
for example you ask the coo why she's

39
00:01:30,640 --> 00:01:37,360
considering a new scheduling system

40
00:01:34,079 --> 00:01:37,840
she says hospital resources seem to be

41
00:01:37,360 --> 00:01:40,960
either

42
00:01:37,840 --> 00:01:43,840
jammed up or sitting idle

43
00:01:40,960 --> 00:01:44,799
when you ask why that happens she

44
00:01:43,840 --> 00:01:47,119
explains that

45
00:01:44,799 --> 00:01:48,399
most procedures require specific

46
00:01:47,119 --> 00:01:51,200
equipment

47
00:01:48,399 --> 00:01:51,520
staff qualified to perform the procedure

48
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:54,479
and

49
00:01:51,520 --> 00:01:55,759
often a specific room to accommodate the

50
00:01:54,479 --> 00:01:57,439
equipment

51
00:01:55,759 --> 00:01:58,960
the current scheduling system and

52
00:01:57,439 --> 00:02:02,159
processes don't take

53
00:01:58,960 --> 00:02:03,439
all that into account the equipment

54
00:02:02,159 --> 00:02:05,920
might be scheduled

55
00:02:03,439 --> 00:02:07,119
but the technician isn't available or

56
00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:10,080
the scheduled room

57
00:02:07,119 --> 00:02:12,080
can't handle the equipment in addition

58
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:13,120
the hospital has received grants and

59
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:15,280
donations to

60
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:16,640
fund improvements to address these

61
00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:18,480
issues

62
00:02:16,640 --> 00:02:19,840
the problem statement for this project

63
00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:22,720
might be

64
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:23,840
hospital resources aren't being utilized

65
00:02:22,720 --> 00:02:25,920
efficiently

66
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:27,680
because scheduling doesn't ensure that

67
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:31,040
the necessary equipment

68
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:33,440
staff and facilities are available

69
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:35,280
funding is available to address

70
00:02:33,440 --> 00:02:37,280
scheduling issues

71
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:39,519
with a problem statement in hand you can

72
00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:42,080
define the project goal

73
00:02:39,519 --> 00:02:43,840
that is the end result the project will

74
00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:46,000
deliver

75
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:48,000
the goal should be simple and easy for

76
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:50,319
everyone to understand

77
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:52,400
that way you can use it to get buy-in

78
00:02:50,319 --> 00:02:54,879
and guide the team to a successful

79
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:56,720
conclusion

80
00:02:54,879 --> 00:02:58,400
for the hospital project the project

81
00:02:56,720 --> 00:03:00,319
goal might be

82
00:02:58,400 --> 00:03:02,720
the project will deliver scheduling

83
00:03:00,319 --> 00:03:03,599
improvements so hospital resources can

84
00:03:02,720 --> 00:03:06,159
be scheduled

85
00:03:03,599 --> 00:03:08,239
efficiently the project will take

86
00:03:06,159 --> 00:03:11,599
advantage of funding available for

87
00:03:08,239 --> 00:03:13,599
productivity and technology enhancements

88
00:03:11,599 --> 00:03:15,920
knowing where you're going is the best

89
00:03:13,599 --> 00:03:17,920
way to start a project

90
00:03:15,920 --> 00:03:20,319
try writing a problem statement and goal

91
00:03:17,920 --> 00:03:22,480
for the project you're working on

92
00:03:20,319 --> 00:03:26,239
using the template included in the

93
00:03:22,480 --> 00:03:26,239
exercise files
