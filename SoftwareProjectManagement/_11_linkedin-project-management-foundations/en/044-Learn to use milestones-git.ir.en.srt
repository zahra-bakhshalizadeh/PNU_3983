00:00:00,570 --> 00:00:06,540

Milestones get their name from the past when people
placed stones by the side of a road to

2


2
00:00:06,540 --> 00:00:13,680

mark each mile in projects, milestones do a
similar job, but they show progress and other

3


3
00:00:13,680 --> 00:00:16,250

key project points rather than distance.

4


4
00:00:17,010 --> 00:00:23,130

They show when you've completed key tasks or portions
of a project, and they make it easy

5


5
00:00:23,130 --> 00:00:26,460
to see how much you've
completed and when it finished.


6

6
00:00:27,350 --> 00:00:32,630

Milestones are great as the first and last
tasks in your project schedule, by starting a

7


7
00:00:32,630 --> 00:00:37,970

project with a milestone, you can reschedule the
project start date just by moving the

8
00:

8
00:37,970 --> 00:00:40,180
starting milestone to a later date.

9


9
00:00:41,030 --> 00:00:47,180

By looking at the final milestone, you can tell
whether the project is on time, late or

10


10
00:00:47,180 --> 00:00:53,670

ahead of schedule. Milestones also help highlight
progress you've made in between the

11


11
00:00:53,670 --> 00:00:59,670

projects start and finish when all the work
leading up to that milestone is done, you



12
12
00:00:59,670 --> 00:01:04,050

have the satisfaction of marking
off another milestone as complete.

13


13
00:01:04,920 --> 00:01:09,900

If you're waiting for someone to deliver something
at a milestone to flag that delivery,

14


14
00:01:10,530 --> 00:01:17,190

finally use a milestone to flag decisions that
determine what happens next in a project

15
15
00:01:17,460 --> 00:01:22,710

or use a milestone for an approval that
determines when the work after the approval can

16


16
00:01:22,710 --> 00:01:30,260

start. Milestone's help indicate progress in a project
when you link them to work tasks.

17


17
00:01:30,560 --> 00:01:36,170

You can also use them to reschedule
portions of a project for practice.



18
18
00:01:36,170 --> 00:01:40,430
Add Milestone's to the network
diagram in the exercise files.
