1
00:00:01,040 --> 00:00:05,520
solving problems and making decisions

2
00:00:03,600 --> 00:00:08,000
have a lot in common

3
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:09,519
if you think about it most decisions you

4
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:11,519
make as a project manager

5
00:00:09,519 --> 00:00:13,599
are about how you're going to solve or

6
00:00:11,519 --> 00:00:15,920
prevent a problem

7
00:00:13,599 --> 00:00:18,080
here are a few tips for making problem

8
00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:21,840
solving easier

9
00:00:18,080 --> 00:00:24,160
first focus on what's important

10
00:00:21,840 --> 00:00:25,039
decisions and problem solving can take

11
00:00:24,160 --> 00:00:27,439
time and

12
00:00:25,039 --> 00:00:28,800
information which are usually in short

13
00:00:27,439 --> 00:00:31,359
supply

14
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:32,880
so be sure to tackle the important

15
00:00:31,359 --> 00:00:36,480
decisions and problems

16
00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:39,520
first you have to learn to ignore

17
00:00:36,480 --> 00:00:41,840
what isn't important no matter how

18
00:00:39,520 --> 00:00:45,200
urgent it appears

19
00:00:41,840 --> 00:00:48,559
when a problem arises ask yourself

20
00:00:45,200 --> 00:00:51,760
is it important if the answer is no

21
00:00:48,559 --> 00:00:54,480
ignore it next

22
00:00:51,760 --> 00:00:56,320
make sure you understand what the

23
00:00:54,480 --> 00:00:58,079
problem is

24
00:00:56,320 --> 00:00:59,920
just like when you develop a problem

25
00:00:58,079 --> 00:01:02,960
statement for the project

26
00:00:59,920 --> 00:01:05,199
third evaluate the impact of problems

27
00:01:02,960 --> 00:01:08,479
and prioritize the ones with the

28
00:01:05,199 --> 00:01:10,400
greatest effect on your project with

29
00:01:08,479 --> 00:01:13,040
problems that have significant

30
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:13,439
and long-lasting effects on your project

31
00:01:13,040 --> 00:01:15,360
it's

32
00:01:13,439 --> 00:01:17,360
really important to pick the best

33
00:01:15,360 --> 00:01:19,759
solution

34
00:01:17,360 --> 00:01:21,280
for issues like these evaluate your

35
00:01:19,759 --> 00:01:24,840
options like you do with

36
00:01:21,280 --> 00:01:28,320
project strategy on the other hand

37
00:01:24,840 --> 00:01:32,560
sometimes doing nothing at all

38
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:33,520
is the answer taking no action on

39
00:01:32,560 --> 00:01:36,799
purpose

40
00:01:33,520 --> 00:01:39,200
is an action and it might be an

41
00:01:36,799 --> 00:01:42,240
acceptable alternative

42
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:44,240
finally ask for help if you need it

43
00:01:42,240 --> 00:01:46,240
others might identify solutions you

44
00:01:44,240 --> 00:01:49,360
wouldn't think of and can help you

45
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:51,840
choose the best alternative

46
00:01:49,360 --> 00:01:52,799
problem solving is something you get to

47
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:56,560
practice

48
00:01:52,799 --> 00:01:58,640
every day there's a list of problems for

49
00:01:56,560 --> 00:02:00,240
the scheduling project in the exercise

50
00:01:58,640 --> 00:02:02,640
files

51
00:02:00,240 --> 00:02:03,840
identify which ones you're going to work

52
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:08,240
on and why

53
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:08,240
you consider them important
