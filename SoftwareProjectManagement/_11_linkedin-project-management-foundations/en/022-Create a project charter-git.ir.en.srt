1
00:00:00,560 --> 00:00:07,359
is the project definition done check

2
00:00:03,840 --> 00:00:09,679
is the scope statement ready check

3
00:00:07,359 --> 00:00:11,360
now you're ready to get approval to move

4
00:00:09,679 --> 00:00:14,400
into planning your project

5
00:00:11,360 --> 00:00:16,880
you also put together a project charter

6
00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:18,320
that officially authorizes the project

7
00:00:16,880 --> 00:00:21,279
and publicizes it

8
00:00:18,320 --> 00:00:21,920
to the world the whole point of defining

9
00:00:21,279 --> 00:00:24,240
a project

10
00:00:21,920 --> 00:00:25,439
is to give the project customer or

11
00:00:24,240 --> 00:00:27,680
management team

12
00:00:25,439 --> 00:00:28,480
the info they need to approve the

13
00:00:27,680 --> 00:00:31,039
project

14
00:00:28,480 --> 00:00:33,360
the review process varies from

15
00:00:31,039 --> 00:00:35,440
organization to organization

16
00:00:33,360 --> 00:00:36,640
typically the customer compares the

17
00:00:35,440 --> 00:00:39,520
project information

18
00:00:36,640 --> 00:00:41,920
to acceptance criteria that align with

19
00:00:39,520 --> 00:00:44,239
the organization's goals

20
00:00:41,920 --> 00:00:45,440
there are three possible outcomes from

21
00:00:44,239 --> 00:00:47,840
this review

22
00:00:45,440 --> 00:00:48,800
the project is approved to proceed to

23
00:00:47,840 --> 00:00:52,960
planning

24
00:00:48,800 --> 00:00:55,199
it's denied or it's sent back for rework

25
00:00:52,960 --> 00:00:56,719
when the project is approved the final

26
00:00:55,199 --> 00:00:59,359
step in initiation

27
00:00:56,719 --> 00:01:00,320
is to create and distribute a project

28
00:00:59,359 --> 00:01:03,120
charter

29
00:01:00,320 --> 00:01:04,400
this document authorizes and publicizes

30
00:01:03,120 --> 00:01:06,240
the project

31
00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:07,439
here's what typically goes into a

32
00:01:06,240 --> 00:01:09,920
project charter

33
00:01:07,439 --> 00:01:10,960
the name of the project the purpose of

34
00:01:09,920 --> 00:01:13,040
the project

35
00:01:10,960 --> 00:01:15,119
a short summary of its goal and

36
00:01:13,040 --> 00:01:18,159
objectives will do

37
00:01:15,119 --> 00:01:20,880
a high level project description

38
00:01:18,159 --> 00:01:22,400
which may include things like high-level

39
00:01:20,880 --> 00:01:26,080
success criteria

40
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:29,280
requirements scope risks assumptions

41
00:01:26,080 --> 00:01:33,280
and constraints a milestone schedule

42
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:36,079
cost estimate and list of stakeholders

43
00:01:33,280 --> 00:01:36,880
remember you'll flesh out all of these

44
00:01:36,079 --> 00:01:39,920
components

45
00:01:36,880 --> 00:01:41,439
once you start planning your project you

46
00:01:39,920 --> 00:01:43,040
also include information about the

47
00:01:41,439 --> 00:01:45,439
project manager

48
00:01:43,040 --> 00:01:46,280
the project manager's name the project

49
00:01:45,439 --> 00:01:49,040
manager's

50
00:01:46,280 --> 00:01:50,960
responsibilities including a brief

51
00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:52,720
description of the work the project

52
00:01:50,960 --> 00:01:55,119
manager does

53
00:01:52,720 --> 00:01:56,479
the extent of the project manager's

54
00:01:55,119 --> 00:01:58,320
authority

55
00:01:56,479 --> 00:02:01,119
and the specific work the project

56
00:01:58,320 --> 00:02:04,000
manager has authority to perform

57
00:02:01,119 --> 00:02:06,159
such as requesting resources or signing

58
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:08,640
contracts

59
00:02:06,159 --> 00:02:09,520
finally the charter includes a formal

60
00:02:08,640 --> 00:02:12,640
declaration

61
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:15,200
of the sponsor's support for the project

62
00:02:12,640 --> 00:02:17,360
think of this declaration as a power of

63
00:02:15,200 --> 00:02:18,400
attorney given to the project manager by

64
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:21,360
the sponsor or

65
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:23,760
customer you might wonder why a project

66
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:27,280
charter describes the project manager's

67
00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:29,200
authority it's because project managers

68
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:32,560
don't have the kind of authority that

69
00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:35,120
managers in a structured organization do

70
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:36,800
project managers authority lasts as long

71
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:39,840
as the projects they manage

72
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:41,760
and applies only to those projects

73
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:42,959
for that reason it's important that

74
00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:45,440
people understand

75
00:02:42,959 --> 00:02:46,879
what a project manager is authorized to

76
00:02:45,440 --> 00:02:49,120
do

77
00:02:46,879 --> 00:02:51,680
when the project charter is ready to go

78
00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:53,360
the project sponsor distributes it to

79
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:56,480
everyone affected by

80
00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:58,319
or involved in the project once the

81
00:02:56,480 --> 00:03:00,640
project has been authorized

82
00:02:58,319 --> 00:03:02,159
and your authority as project manager is

83
00:03:00,640 --> 00:03:05,400
common knowledge

84
00:03:02,159 --> 00:03:08,400
you're ready to begin planning the

85
00:03:05,400 --> 00:03:08,400
project
