1
00:00:00,849 --> 00:00:06,529
Lots of project managers get their start because
they're good at making things happen, but

2
00:00:06,529 --> 00:00:10,830
project management is more than showing off
your organizational skills and supervising

3
00:00:10,830 --> 00:00:12,490
others.

4
00:00:12,490 --> 00:00:20,430
It means applying knowledge, skills, tools
and techniques to achieve your project's objectives.

5
00:00:20,430 --> 00:00:26,490
Project management can be summed up as answering
a few crucial questions, the first question

6
00:00:26,490 --> 00:00:30,950
you have to answer is what problem are you
solving?

7
00:00:30,950 --> 00:00:35,760
Clearly defining what the project is supposed
to accomplish is a big step toward making

8
00:00:35,760 --> 00:00:38,069
it a success.

9
00:00:38,069 --> 00:00:41,370
Legendary baseball manager Yogi Berra is off
kilter.

10
00:00:41,370 --> 00:00:42,800
Take on it is.

11
00:00:42,800 --> 00:00:46,179
You've got to be very careful if you don't
know where you're going because you might

12
00:00:46,179 --> 00:00:48,210
not get there.

13
00:00:48,210 --> 00:00:52,579
The second question is, how are you going
to solve this problem?

14
00:00:52,579 --> 00:00:57,289
Whether you're solving a problem or pursuing
an opportunity, you might have to choose from

15
00:00:57,289 --> 00:00:59,989
several possible strategies.

16
00:00:59,989 --> 00:01:06,689
Once you've picked your approach, it's time
to flesh out your solution gathering requirements,

17
00:01:06,689 --> 00:01:10,770
identifying deliverables and defining project
scope.

18
00:01:10,770 --> 00:01:14,579
The next question is, what's your plan?

19
00:01:14,579 --> 00:01:18,390
A big part of project management is planning
your project.

20
00:01:18,390 --> 00:01:25,360
You have to identify the work to be done in
detail, how long it might take, the resources

21
00:01:25,360 --> 00:01:28,460
you need and how much they cost.

22
00:01:28,460 --> 00:01:33,850
With that info in hand, you can build a schedule
of when work should occur.

23
00:01:33,850 --> 00:01:38,330
While you're at it, you also need to spell
out how you want things to happen in your

24
00:01:38,330 --> 00:01:43,460
project, like communication, managing changes
and so on.

25
00:01:43,460 --> 00:01:51,590
Some projects seem to go on forever, but eventually
someone will pull the plug if it doesn't finish.

26
00:01:51,590 --> 00:01:57,280
That's why you also have to answer the question,
how will you know when you're done?

27
00:01:57,280 --> 00:02:02,659
Clearly defined objectives, requirements and
deliverables help answer that question, but

28
00:02:02,659 --> 00:02:09,880
you can eliminate uncertainty by defining
success criteria, quantifiable, measurable

29
00:02:09,880 --> 00:02:16,840
results that show that the project is complete,
like a certificate of occupancy for construction

30
00:02:16,840 --> 00:02:22,050
or increased productivity measurements after
a system is implemented.

31
00:02:22,050 --> 00:02:27,120
When you get to the end of the project, you're
ready to answer the last question.

32
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:30,190
How well did the project go?

33
00:02:30,190 --> 00:02:35,620
This important step is often skipped because
everyone is so ready to move on to the next

34
00:02:35,620 --> 00:02:36,960
deal.

35
00:02:36,960 --> 00:02:45,230
You really need to take time to review the
project, what worked well, what didn't, why?

36
00:02:45,230 --> 00:02:51,310
How could we have done better? Project management
boils down to answering several questions

37
00:02:51,310 --> 00:02:53,120
about your project.

38
00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:55,240
What problem are you solving?

39
00:02:55,240 --> 00:02:57,370
How are you going to solve it?

40
00:02:57,370 --> 00:03:00,200
What's your plan for getting the project done?

41
00:03:00,200 --> 00:03:02,380
How can you tell when you're done?

42
00:03:02,380 --> 00:03:04,510
And how well did the project go?
