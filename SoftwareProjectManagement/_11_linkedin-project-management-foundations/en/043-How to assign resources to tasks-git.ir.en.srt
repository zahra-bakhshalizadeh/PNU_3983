1
00:00:00,640 --> 00:00:05,920
your project tasks are in sequence

2
00:00:03,360 --> 00:00:08,000
and you've estimated their durations the

3
00:00:05,920 --> 00:00:10,480
final piece of your scheduling puzzle

4
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:11,920
is how many people work on each task and

5
00:00:10,480 --> 00:00:14,320
when they're available

6
00:00:11,920 --> 00:00:15,440
with that info you can see how long

7
00:00:14,320 --> 00:00:18,480
tasks take

8
00:00:15,440 --> 00:00:21,840
and when they should occur you assign

9
00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:24,960
resources only to work packages

10
00:00:21,840 --> 00:00:26,000
the lowest levels in your wbs because

11
00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:29,439
they represent

12
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:32,000
work that must be done summary tasks

13
00:00:29,439 --> 00:00:35,360
roll up work from lower levels so you

14
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:37,840
don't assign resources to these tasks

15
00:00:35,360 --> 00:00:39,840
milestones don't have duration so it

16
00:00:37,840 --> 00:00:41,600
doesn't make sense to assign resources

17
00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:43,680
to them either

18
00:00:41,600 --> 00:00:45,120
what happens when you assign resources

19
00:00:43,680 --> 00:00:47,520
to work packages

20
00:00:45,120 --> 00:00:48,480
depends on whether you estimate task

21
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:51,920
duration

22
00:00:48,480 --> 00:00:54,079
or work let's say you estimate duration

23
00:00:51,920 --> 00:00:56,719
and assign the number of resources

24
00:00:54,079 --> 00:00:58,160
you expect to get your scheduling tool

25
00:00:56,719 --> 00:01:00,640
will calculate the work

26
00:00:58,160 --> 00:01:01,840
those resources can perform in that

27
00:01:00,640 --> 00:01:04,080
duration

28
00:01:01,840 --> 00:01:04,879
let's say you're expecting two vendor

29
00:01:04,080 --> 00:01:08,400
resources

30
00:01:04,879 --> 00:01:11,920
full time to design scheduling features

31
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:13,040
the task duration estimate is two weeks

32
00:01:11,920 --> 00:01:16,799
two people

33
00:01:13,040 --> 00:01:18,080
working full time for two weeks is 160

34
00:01:16,799 --> 00:01:20,720
hours

35
00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:22,159
on the other hand if you estimate work

36
00:01:20,720 --> 00:01:24,880
your scheduling tool

37
00:01:22,159 --> 00:01:25,680
uses the work estimate and the resource

38
00:01:24,880 --> 00:01:29,280
allocation

39
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:32,400
to calculate the task duration

40
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:35,439
some tasks don't get shorter no matter

41
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:38,400
how many people you assign meetings

42
00:01:35,439 --> 00:01:39,280
are the classic example a four-hour

43
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:41,759
meeting is

44
00:01:39,280 --> 00:01:42,720
four hours long whether three people

45
00:01:41,759 --> 00:01:46,079
attend or

46
00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:46,799
ten when resources are available also

47
00:01:46,079 --> 00:01:50,000
affects

48
00:01:46,799 --> 00:01:50,640
when work occurs for example your

49
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,720
schedule

50
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:54,799
might show the equipment installation

51
00:01:52,720 --> 00:01:57,200
starting on november 9th

52
00:01:54,799 --> 00:01:58,159
if your it folks are wrapping up another

53
00:01:57,200 --> 00:02:00,320
installation

54
00:01:58,159 --> 00:02:01,680
and the team won't be available until

55
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:04,880
november 18th

56
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:05,759
guess what you have to delay that task

57
00:02:04,880 --> 00:02:09,039
in your schedule

58
00:02:05,759 --> 00:02:11,039
to when the resources are available

59
00:02:09,039 --> 00:02:12,560
don't forget to assign other types of

60
00:02:11,039 --> 00:02:15,520
resources you need

61
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:17,040
like materials equipment and ancillary

62
00:02:15,520 --> 00:02:19,840
costs

63
00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:21,280
with all resources assigned you finally

64
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:24,640
get a good idea

65
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:27,520
what the schedule looks like to practice

66
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:31,840
work through the assignment exercise in

67
00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:31,840
the exercise files
