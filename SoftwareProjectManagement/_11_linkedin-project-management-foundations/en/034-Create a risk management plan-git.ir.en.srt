1
00:00:00,560 --> 00:00:05,680
a risk management plan documents

2
00:00:03,439 --> 00:00:08,400
which risks you're going to worry about

3
00:00:05,680 --> 00:00:11,920
and how you plan to handle them

4
00:00:08,400 --> 00:00:15,360
first identify which risks warrant

5
00:00:11,920 --> 00:00:16,480
managing start by evaluating how likely

6
00:00:15,360 --> 00:00:19,600
they are and how

7
00:00:16,480 --> 00:00:22,800
serious their impact would be

8
00:00:19,600 --> 00:00:25,840
rate risks by probability and impact

9
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:29,519
using a scale of one to five where

10
00:00:25,840 --> 00:00:32,880
one is unlikely or not serious

11
00:00:29,519 --> 00:00:34,239
and five is highly likely or extremely

12
00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:36,960
serious

13
00:00:34,239 --> 00:00:38,079
then multiply the probability and impact

14
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:42,160
to calculate

15
00:00:38,079 --> 00:00:43,760
a risk score it makes sense to manage

16
00:00:42,160 --> 00:00:47,440
risks that are at least

17
00:00:43,760 --> 00:00:49,920
fairly likely and serious that means

18
00:00:47,440 --> 00:00:50,480
you need a plan for any risk with a

19
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:54,640
score

20
00:00:50,480 --> 00:00:57,360
of nine or more for example

21
00:00:54,640 --> 00:00:57,840
suppose older hospital computers are

22
00:00:57,360 --> 00:01:00,719
very

23
00:00:57,840 --> 00:01:02,559
likely to be incompatible with the new

24
00:01:00,719 --> 00:01:05,439
scheduling systems

25
00:01:02,559 --> 00:01:06,320
new computers increase the budget so the

26
00:01:05,439 --> 00:01:10,720
impact is

27
00:01:06,320 --> 00:01:13,920
very serious the risks score is 25

28
00:01:10,720 --> 00:01:16,799
so you'll definitely need to manage it

29
00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:18,000
risk 1's probability and impact are both

30
00:01:16,799 --> 00:01:20,960
medium

31
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:21,840
its score is 9 and you need to plan for

32
00:01:20,960 --> 00:01:25,600
it

33
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:26,720
risk 4 is fairly serious but it isn't

34
00:01:25,600 --> 00:01:30,240
likely

35
00:01:26,720 --> 00:01:31,840
its score is three so you won't plan for

36
00:01:30,240 --> 00:01:34,560
it

37
00:01:31,840 --> 00:01:35,520
next you plan how you'll handle each

38
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:38,159
risk

39
00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:40,560
the goal of a risk response is to plan

40
00:01:38,159 --> 00:01:43,119
the actions you would take to reduce

41
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:44,960
adverse consequences a risk might have

42
00:01:43,119 --> 00:01:47,920
on your project

43
00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:49,840
here are some risk responses you can use

44
00:01:47,920 --> 00:01:53,040
the easiest option

45
00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:55,119
is to accept the consequences

46
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:56,399
that's fine for risks with low

47
00:01:55,119 --> 00:02:00,320
probability and

48
00:01:56,399 --> 00:02:02,479
impact avoiding risk is another approach

49
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:03,920
for instance changing the project's

50
00:02:02,479 --> 00:02:07,439
scope to remove

51
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:08,000
the risky part of the project mitigating

52
00:02:07,439 --> 00:02:10,160
risk

53
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:11,200
means taking steps to reduce the

54
00:02:10,160 --> 00:02:14,319
consequences

55
00:02:11,200 --> 00:02:16,959
or impact of the risk for example

56
00:02:14,319 --> 00:02:18,400
by running a feasibility study you'll

57
00:02:16,959 --> 00:02:20,400
have a better idea

58
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:21,520
whether a scheduling system will meet

59
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:24,560
the schedule

60
00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:26,959
budget and other objectives

61
00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:28,560
transferring risk means handing off the

62
00:02:26,959 --> 00:02:31,360
risk to someone else

63
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:32,640
like when you purchase insurance this

64
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:36,160
reduces risk

65
00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:36,720
but doesn't eliminate it insurance might

66
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:39,680
relieve

67
00:02:36,720 --> 00:02:42,080
costs it won't eliminate other factors

68
00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:44,879
like time delays

69
00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:46,879
make sure your responses aren't overkill

70
00:02:44,879 --> 00:02:50,560
if a schedule delay triggers a

71
00:02:46,879 --> 00:02:51,040
500 late fee it doesn't make sense to

72
00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:53,360
spend

73
00:02:51,040 --> 00:02:54,879
five thousand dollars to prevent the

74
00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:57,599
delay

75
00:02:54,879 --> 00:02:59,440
remember contingency time and funds can

76
00:02:57,599 --> 00:03:02,560
be used to handle risks

77
00:02:59,440 --> 00:03:04,319
that have no other response or to handle

78
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:07,760
risks you didn't identify

79
00:03:04,319 --> 00:03:09,599
up front the final step in a risk

80
00:03:07,760 --> 00:03:11,920
management plan is defining

81
00:03:09,599 --> 00:03:13,519
how to monitor risks and measure

82
00:03:11,920 --> 00:03:16,000
responses

83
00:03:13,519 --> 00:03:17,360
create a risk log to summarize the risks

84
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:20,080
you'll manage

85
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:21,120
for each risk include a description of

86
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:23,680
the risk

87
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:24,799
the events or circumstances that trigger

88
00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:27,760
the risk

89
00:03:24,799 --> 00:03:29,280
the probability and impact the response

90
00:03:27,760 --> 00:03:32,400
you've chosen

91
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:33,920
who will monitor the risk the result you

92
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:37,120
expect from the response

93
00:03:33,920 --> 00:03:39,440
if you have to use it and finally the

94
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:42,720
risk status

95
00:03:39,440 --> 00:03:45,200
keep your risk plan up to date as the

96
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:47,599
project progresses

97
00:03:45,200 --> 00:03:48,640
some risks become less likely as time

98
00:03:47,599 --> 00:03:50,959
passes

99
00:03:48,640 --> 00:03:52,640
other risks may be introduced because of

100
00:03:50,959 --> 00:03:55,599
project changes

101
00:03:52,640 --> 00:03:56,159
risks occur so you track what caused

102
00:03:55,599 --> 00:03:58,879
them

103
00:03:56,159 --> 00:04:00,319
their impact and whether your responses

104
00:03:58,879 --> 00:04:02,560
are working

105
00:04:00,319 --> 00:04:03,599
a risk management plan helps protect

106
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:06,640
your project from

107
00:04:03,599 --> 00:04:09,200
things that can go wrong for practice

108
00:04:06,640 --> 00:04:13,360
fill out more of the risk log in the

109
00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:13,360
exercise files
