1
00:00:00,640 --> 00:00:04,080
another aspect of defining a project is

2
00:00:03,199 --> 00:00:07,040
to identify

3
00:00:04,080 --> 00:00:08,800
project assumptions and risks let's

4
00:00:07,040 --> 00:00:11,200
start with assumptions

5
00:00:08,800 --> 00:00:12,639
during project initiation there's a good

6
00:00:11,200 --> 00:00:14,719
chance you won't have all the

7
00:00:12,639 --> 00:00:17,039
information you really need

8
00:00:14,719 --> 00:00:18,320
don't worry you can make assumptions

9
00:00:17,039 --> 00:00:20,480
about that info

10
00:00:18,320 --> 00:00:22,560
so you can move ahead with the project

11
00:00:20,480 --> 00:00:23,439
later when the project picture becomes

12
00:00:22,560 --> 00:00:25,920
clearer

13
00:00:23,439 --> 00:00:26,720
you can revisit your assumptions and

14
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:29,760
modify them

15
00:00:26,720 --> 00:00:32,079
if necessary for example

16
00:00:29,760 --> 00:00:34,640
with a scheduling project you won't know

17
00:00:32,079 --> 00:00:36,880
how much system customization is needed

18
00:00:34,640 --> 00:00:38,160
until you choose the vendor and that

19
00:00:36,880 --> 00:00:40,320
could affect how many

20
00:00:38,160 --> 00:00:42,719
in-house resources you'll need which

21
00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:45,120
could affect how long the project takes

22
00:00:42,719 --> 00:00:46,079
you get the idea you might assume that

23
00:00:45,120 --> 00:00:48,960
the system

24
00:00:46,079 --> 00:00:51,039
won't require much customization from

25
00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:53,920
that you estimate that you'll need

26
00:00:51,039 --> 00:00:55,920
three in-house it resources and they'll

27
00:00:53,920 --> 00:00:57,440
need a month to finish their part of the

28
00:00:55,920 --> 00:00:59,840
project

29
00:00:57,440 --> 00:01:01,199
assumptions can be tricky when people

30
00:00:59,840 --> 00:01:04,239
don't realize

31
00:01:01,199 --> 00:01:06,880
they're assuming something in that case

32
00:01:04,239 --> 00:01:08,479
they assume something is true without

33
00:01:06,880 --> 00:01:10,240
confirming it

34
00:01:08,479 --> 00:01:11,600
different people can make different

35
00:01:10,240 --> 00:01:13,920
assumptions

36
00:01:11,600 --> 00:01:15,040
if those assumptions aren't brought into

37
00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:18,320
the open

38
00:01:15,040 --> 00:01:21,439
someone will end up disappointed

39
00:01:18,320 --> 00:01:22,400
for example say that you assume that the

40
00:01:21,439 --> 00:01:25,040
system vendor

41
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:26,960
is going to load data into the database

42
00:01:25,040 --> 00:01:28,080
and the system vendor assumes your

43
00:01:26,960 --> 00:01:30,560
internal it

44
00:01:28,080 --> 00:01:32,479
group will do that task if that

45
00:01:30,560 --> 00:01:34,560
assumption isn't identified

46
00:01:32,479 --> 00:01:36,000
the system might miss an important

47
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:39,280
deadline

48
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:42,320
the key is to get assumptions out

49
00:01:39,280 --> 00:01:45,280
in the open that way you can make sure

50
00:01:42,320 --> 00:01:46,159
everyone is on the same page think about

51
00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:48,560
uncovering

52
00:01:46,159 --> 00:01:50,479
unspoken assumptions as you define and

53
00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:53,280
plan the project

54
00:01:50,479 --> 00:01:54,159
ask people what they expect and what

55
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:56,719
they envision

56
00:01:54,159 --> 00:01:57,600
when they think about the project don't

57
00:01:56,719 --> 00:02:01,040
be shy

58
00:01:57,600 --> 00:02:04,079
about asking more than once

59
00:02:01,040 --> 00:02:05,439
now let's look at risks a risk is a

60
00:02:04,079 --> 00:02:07,680
situation or event

61
00:02:05,439 --> 00:02:08,720
that might occur that could affect your

62
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:11,680
project

63
00:02:08,720 --> 00:02:12,800
positively or negatively what makes a

64
00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:16,319
risk a risk

65
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:17,120
is that it's uncertain early on in a

66
00:02:16,319 --> 00:02:19,760
project

67
00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:21,599
spend some time identifying risks that

68
00:02:19,760 --> 00:02:24,000
could affect the project

69
00:02:21,599 --> 00:02:25,599
mainly so the management team can make

70
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:27,840
an educated decision

71
00:02:25,599 --> 00:02:29,280
about whether or not to invest in the

72
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:32,160
project

73
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:32,800
if you identify numerous risks and

74
00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:36,000
several

75
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:37,680
are quite worrisome management

76
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:40,959
might decide it would be better to

77
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:44,160
forego the project for another one

78
00:02:40,959 --> 00:02:46,000
assumptions and risks are manageable as

79
00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:49,760
long as you identify them

80
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:50,239
up front for practice try identifying a

81
00:02:49,760 --> 00:02:52,400
few

82
00:02:50,239 --> 00:02:53,519
assumptions and risks that could arise

83
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:57,599
in the hospital

84
00:02:53,519 --> 00:02:57,599
scheduling project
