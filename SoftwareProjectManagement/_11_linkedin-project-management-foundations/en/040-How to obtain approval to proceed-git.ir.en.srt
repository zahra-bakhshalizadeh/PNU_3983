1
00:00:00,799 --> 00:00:04,960
now that you have a plan for the project

2
00:00:03,120 --> 00:00:08,559
you need to get the stakeholders to

3
00:00:04,960 --> 00:00:10,480
approve the plan so you can start work

4
00:00:08,559 --> 00:00:12,880
getting approval is important because

5
00:00:10,480 --> 00:00:13,920
you need the stakeholders commitment to

6
00:00:12,880 --> 00:00:17,279
make the project

7
00:00:13,920 --> 00:00:18,160
a success you might think about getting

8
00:00:17,279 --> 00:00:20,080
approval by

9
00:00:18,160 --> 00:00:22,480
mailing or emailing a packet to

10
00:00:20,080 --> 00:00:24,160
stakeholders and asking them to sign on

11
00:00:22,480 --> 00:00:27,279
the dotted line

12
00:00:24,160 --> 00:00:28,720
i don't recommend that approach here's

13
00:00:27,279 --> 00:00:30,560
the problem

14
00:00:28,720 --> 00:00:33,680
people probably won't read through the

15
00:00:30,560 --> 00:00:35,680
plan sure they might sign their names

16
00:00:33,680 --> 00:00:36,960
but later if they find something they

17
00:00:35,680 --> 00:00:39,360
disagree with

18
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:42,320
their commitment disappears and you end

19
00:00:39,360 --> 00:00:44,800
up back to planning

20
00:00:42,320 --> 00:00:46,160
a face-to-face sign-off meeting is more

21
00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:48,399
effective

22
00:00:46,160 --> 00:00:50,079
schedule a meeting specifically for

23
00:00:48,399 --> 00:00:53,760
getting approval

24
00:00:50,079 --> 00:00:56,239
the agenda is straightforward

25
00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:57,680
first present the project plan to make

26
00:00:56,239 --> 00:01:01,120
sure that the stakeholders

27
00:00:57,680 --> 00:01:04,720
agree with it if issues arise

28
00:01:01,120 --> 00:01:07,439
deal with them right then and there

29
00:01:04,720 --> 00:01:09,439
or if the issues are big enough you

30
00:01:07,439 --> 00:01:12,400
might have to reschedule the sign off

31
00:01:09,439 --> 00:01:13,040
so you can rework the plan once everyone

32
00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:15,600
agrees

33
00:01:13,040 --> 00:01:17,520
ask them all to sign a signature page to

34
00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:19,600
indicate their approval

35
00:01:17,520 --> 00:01:22,320
if you can't get everyone in the same

36
00:01:19,600 --> 00:01:24,479
room a video conference or conference

37
00:01:22,320 --> 00:01:26,640
call works too

38
00:01:24,479 --> 00:01:28,720
ask the people in other locations to

39
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:33,520
transmit their signatures to you by

40
00:01:28,720 --> 00:01:35,520
fax email or even snail mail

41
00:01:33,520 --> 00:01:37,600
signing a project plan isn't like

42
00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:38,799
signing a legal document

43
00:01:37,600 --> 00:01:40,799
you're never going to go back to your

44
00:01:38,799 --> 00:01:43,920
stakeholders and say but you

45
00:01:40,799 --> 00:01:46,079
signed this what's important

46
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:47,680
is that the stakeholders understand what

47
00:01:46,079 --> 00:01:51,439
the project is about

48
00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:51,439
and buy into it
