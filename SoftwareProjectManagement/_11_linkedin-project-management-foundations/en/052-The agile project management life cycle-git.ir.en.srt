1
00:00:00,560 --> 00:00:03,840
the agile project management life cycle

2
00:00:02,800 --> 00:00:07,200
is made up of

3
00:00:03,840 --> 00:00:10,320
five stages envision speculate

4
00:00:07,200 --> 00:00:12,639
explore adapt and close

5
00:00:10,320 --> 00:00:13,440
the envision stage is the start of your

6
00:00:12,639 --> 00:00:16,320
project

7
00:00:13,440 --> 00:00:18,560
when you and the customer well envision

8
00:00:16,320 --> 00:00:20,480
what you're going to deliver

9
00:00:18,560 --> 00:00:22,640
you define the project goal and

10
00:00:20,480 --> 00:00:25,199
objectives and figure out

11
00:00:22,640 --> 00:00:26,880
who you need on your team you also set

12
00:00:25,199 --> 00:00:27,680
up the guidelines for how you'll run the

13
00:00:26,880 --> 00:00:30,080
project

14
00:00:27,680 --> 00:00:31,119
things like how the team works to solve

15
00:00:30,080 --> 00:00:33,680
problems

16
00:00:31,119 --> 00:00:36,000
how you'll collaborate and communicate

17
00:00:33,680 --> 00:00:38,000
what hours the team works

18
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:39,520
when envisioning is done you'll have a

19
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:41,920
project definition

20
00:00:39,520 --> 00:00:42,840
that spells out the project customer

21
00:00:41,920 --> 00:00:46,399
goal

22
00:00:42,840 --> 00:00:48,719
objectives scope and stakeholders

23
00:00:46,399 --> 00:00:50,480
at this point in the life cycle an agile

24
00:00:48,719 --> 00:00:53,360
project diverges from

25
00:00:50,480 --> 00:00:54,320
the waterfall approach for each

26
00:00:53,360 --> 00:00:57,039
iteration

27
00:00:54,320 --> 00:00:59,120
you cycle through the speculate explore

28
00:00:57,039 --> 00:01:02,079
and adapt stages

29
00:00:59,120 --> 00:01:03,440
the speculate stage is about planning

30
00:01:02,079 --> 00:01:07,280
except that you plan

31
00:01:03,440 --> 00:01:09,439
an iteration not the entire project

32
00:01:07,280 --> 00:01:11,119
part of the plan is identifying the

33
00:01:09,439 --> 00:01:13,520
business functions you'll address

34
00:01:11,119 --> 00:01:15,119
in the iteration and the features you'll

35
00:01:13,520 --> 00:01:17,840
develop to satisfy

36
00:01:15,119 --> 00:01:18,320
those requirements you estimate the

37
00:01:17,840 --> 00:01:21,200
effort

38
00:01:18,320 --> 00:01:22,400
for each feature and you identify or

39
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:25,840
update risks

40
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:26,240
related to those features just like that

41
00:01:25,840 --> 00:01:28,960
you're

42
00:01:26,240 --> 00:01:29,520
at the explore stage this is where the

43
00:01:28,960 --> 00:01:32,960
team

44
00:01:29,520 --> 00:01:34,240
builds the iterations features remember

45
00:01:32,960 --> 00:01:37,040
how agile uses

46
00:01:34,240 --> 00:01:38,640
interaction when it's needed the

47
00:01:37,040 --> 00:01:41,040
business and technical folks

48
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:42,799
also hold frequent peer reviews of

49
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:45,759
features in development

50
00:01:42,799 --> 00:01:47,200
to provide feedback on what's been done

51
00:01:45,759 --> 00:01:49,360
the team also tests

52
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:52,159
what they're building so it's production

53
00:01:49,360 --> 00:01:54,640
ready at the end of the iteration

54
00:01:52,159 --> 00:01:56,399
the adapt stage gives you a chance to

55
00:01:54,640 --> 00:02:00,159
act on the feedback you get

56
00:01:56,399 --> 00:02:02,799
and fix things that aren't quite right

57
00:02:00,159 --> 00:02:06,000
product owner or customer conducts a

58
00:02:02,799 --> 00:02:08,479
final review of the iterations features

59
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:10,640
you hold a team meeting to evaluate what

60
00:02:08,479 --> 00:02:13,120
happened during the iteration

61
00:02:10,640 --> 00:02:15,280
that way you can capture lessons learned

62
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:18,640
and adjust the plans for future

63
00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:19,200
iterations once you complete the adapt

64
00:02:18,640 --> 00:02:21,760
stage

65
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:23,120
you repeat the speculate explore and

66
00:02:21,760 --> 00:02:26,640
adapt stages

67
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:28,879
until all the features are complete or

68
00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:31,360
you've used up the time and budget

69
00:02:28,879 --> 00:02:33,280
allocated to the project

70
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:35,040
when the features are done you're ready

71
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:37,680
for the close stage

72
00:02:35,040 --> 00:02:38,640
it's time to make sure everything is

73
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:41,519
done

74
00:02:38,640 --> 00:02:42,160
you also produce a final set of lessons

75
00:02:41,519 --> 00:02:45,599
learned

76
00:02:42,160 --> 00:02:47,840
to use in future projects

77
00:02:45,599 --> 00:02:49,120
the agile life cycle steps through

78
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:51,200
stages for each

79
00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:53,120
iteration so you can start building

80
00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:55,440
features more quickly

81
00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:57,040
try building a schedule that shows the

82
00:02:55,440 --> 00:02:59,120
agile life cycle with

83
00:02:57,040 --> 00:03:03,120
four iterations for the hospital

84
00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:03,120
scheduling system
