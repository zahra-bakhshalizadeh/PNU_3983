1
00:00:00,640 --> 00:00:03,360
the best way to build a work breakdown

2
00:00:02,720 --> 00:00:06,560
structure

3
00:00:03,360 --> 00:00:07,520
or wbs is to start at the top level of

4
00:00:06,560 --> 00:00:10,480
summary tasks

5
00:00:07,520 --> 00:00:13,519
and work your way down work with your

6
00:00:10,480 --> 00:00:15,679
team to identify the wbs

7
00:00:13,519 --> 00:00:16,880
you're less likely to forget work that

8
00:00:15,679 --> 00:00:19,359
needs to be done

9
00:00:16,880 --> 00:00:20,960
and the team is more likely to buy into

10
00:00:19,359 --> 00:00:23,840
the project

11
00:00:20,960 --> 00:00:26,000
as a team you identify the top few

12
00:00:23,840 --> 00:00:28,160
levels of summary tasks

13
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:30,320
then you can have smaller groups break

14
00:00:28,160 --> 00:00:31,439
down the summary tasks into smaller

15
00:00:30,320 --> 00:00:33,920
chunks

16
00:00:31,439 --> 00:00:35,600
at the end everyone gets back together

17
00:00:33,920 --> 00:00:38,559
to review the results

18
00:00:35,600 --> 00:00:40,079
and correct any issues if the full team

19
00:00:38,559 --> 00:00:42,000
isn't on board yet

20
00:00:40,079 --> 00:00:44,879
work with your initial team to

21
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:47,680
brainstorm the wbs

22
00:00:44,879 --> 00:00:49,680
then you can revise and add more detail

23
00:00:47,680 --> 00:00:52,480
to the wbs later

24
00:00:49,680 --> 00:00:54,160
as others join the project start by

25
00:00:52,480 --> 00:00:56,719
using the scope statement

26
00:00:54,160 --> 00:00:58,719
and deliverables to identify the top

27
00:00:56,719 --> 00:01:00,879
level summary tasks

28
00:00:58,719 --> 00:01:02,480
for example the scope for the scheduling

29
00:01:00,879 --> 00:01:05,840
project includes

30
00:01:02,480 --> 00:01:07,439
redesigned scheduling processes a new

31
00:01:05,840 --> 00:01:10,799
scheduling system

32
00:01:07,439 --> 00:01:14,400
documentation and training so you add

33
00:01:10,799 --> 00:01:17,119
summary tasks to cover all of those

34
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:17,680
next break down each of the summary

35
00:01:17,119 --> 00:01:20,960
tasks

36
00:01:17,680 --> 00:01:22,720
into smaller pieces intermediate

37
00:01:20,960 --> 00:01:23,759
deliverables come in handy for

38
00:01:22,720 --> 00:01:25,920
identifying

39
00:01:23,759 --> 00:01:27,520
lower level summary tasks and work

40
00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:29,840
packages

41
00:01:27,520 --> 00:01:32,079
for example the scheduling project

42
00:01:29,840 --> 00:01:34,799
includes a deliverable for a signed

43
00:01:32,079 --> 00:01:38,000
contract with the system vendor

44
00:01:34,799 --> 00:01:41,280
let's add tasks to obtain proposals

45
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:45,119
select the vendor negotiate terms

46
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:48,159
and sign the contract you might wonder

47
00:01:45,119 --> 00:01:51,040
how much breakdown is enough most

48
00:01:48,159 --> 00:01:52,079
project managers shoot for work packages

49
00:01:51,040 --> 00:01:55,920
that take between

50
00:01:52,079 --> 00:01:58,880
8 and 80 hours to complete work packages

51
00:01:55,920 --> 00:02:00,719
are the lowest level tasks in the wbs

52
00:01:58,880 --> 00:02:01,840
and represent the work that needs to be

53
00:02:00,719 --> 00:02:04,079
done

54
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:04,880
consider breaking down work to match the

55
00:02:04,079 --> 00:02:08,000
frequency

56
00:02:04,880 --> 00:02:10,560
of your status reports that way you

57
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:11,360
have measurable progress and completed

58
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:14,879
tasks for

59
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:16,720
every status report here are some tests

60
00:02:14,879 --> 00:02:19,120
to determine whether you've broken work

61
00:02:16,720 --> 00:02:22,879
down to the right level

62
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:26,000
time and cost are easy to estimate

63
00:02:22,879 --> 00:02:28,080
status is easy to measure

64
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:29,920
task durations are shorter than your

65
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:32,879
reporting periods

66
00:02:29,920 --> 00:02:35,120
the detail is at the level you can and

67
00:02:32,879 --> 00:02:36,879
want to manage

68
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:38,319
different parts of a project might

69
00:02:36,879 --> 00:02:40,239
require different levels of

70
00:02:38,319 --> 00:02:42,080
decomposition

71
00:02:40,239 --> 00:02:44,400
one part of the project might include

72
00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:46,080
more work so you break it down to three

73
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:47,519
or four levels

74
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:51,040
if another part of the project is

75
00:02:47,519 --> 00:02:52,560
simpler you might need only two levels

76
00:02:51,040 --> 00:02:55,200
don't worry about the initial

77
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:57,599
organization of your wbs

78
00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:59,920
you can rearrange it later as you learn

79
00:02:57,599 --> 00:03:02,720
more about the project

80
00:02:59,920 --> 00:03:03,280
building a wbs from the top down works

81
00:03:02,720 --> 00:03:05,360
well

82
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:08,400
because you can use the scope statement

83
00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:11,040
and deliverables to get started

84
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:13,280
for practice try building more of the

85
00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:15,560
scheduling projects wbs

86
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:18,560
based on the project scope and

87
00:03:15,560 --> 00:03:18,560
deliverables
