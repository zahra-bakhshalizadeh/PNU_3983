[Music]

2
00:00:05,680 --> 00:00:08,240
at this point in the hospital scheduling

3
00:00:07,520 --> 00:00:10,639
project

4
00:00:08,240 --> 00:00:12,320
you've created drafts of several

5
00:00:10,639 --> 00:00:15,040
planning documents

6
00:00:12,320 --> 00:00:16,160
but in the project world things change

7
00:00:15,040 --> 00:00:19,199
and this project

8
00:00:16,160 --> 00:00:21,119
is no exception the government has

9
00:00:19,199 --> 00:00:23,279
launched a major initiative

10
00:00:21,119 --> 00:00:24,240
in cancer research part of this

11
00:00:23,279 --> 00:00:26,880
initiative is

12
00:00:24,240 --> 00:00:29,119
using a common scheduling tool for all

13
00:00:26,880 --> 00:00:31,519
cancer treatment facilities

14
00:00:29,119 --> 00:00:33,440
brisland hospital's new cancer ward will

15
00:00:31,519 --> 00:00:34,320
have to use the government scheduling

16
00:00:33,440 --> 00:00:36,079
tool

17
00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:37,840
instead of the solution that your

18
00:00:36,079 --> 00:00:39,280
project will implement for the rest of

19
00:00:37,840 --> 00:00:41,360
the hospital

20
00:00:39,280 --> 00:00:44,160
in the exercise files there's a change

21
00:00:41,360 --> 00:00:47,039
request submitted by the project manager

22
00:00:44,160 --> 00:00:47,440
and approved by the project customer

23
00:00:47,039 --> 00:00:50,000
this

24
00:00:47,440 --> 00:00:51,760
change means that you'll have to revise

25
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:54,320
some planning documents

26
00:00:51,760 --> 00:00:55,440
for this challenge take 20 to 30 minutes

27
00:00:54,320 --> 00:00:57,520
to identify

28
00:00:55,440 --> 00:00:58,719
which planning documents you need to

29
00:00:57,520 --> 00:01:01,120
revise

30
00:00:58,719 --> 00:01:02,559
and at a high level what you would

31
00:01:01,120 --> 00:01:05,280
change

32
00:01:02,559 --> 00:01:06,320
after you work through your solution

33
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:09,080
look at the files

34
00:01:06,320 --> 00:01:12,080
i would revise in response to this

35
00:01:09,080 --> 00:01:12,080
request
