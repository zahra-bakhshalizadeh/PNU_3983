1
00:00:00,640 --> 00:00:04,319
organizations can be structured in

2
00:00:02,960 --> 00:00:06,799
several ways

3
00:00:04,319 --> 00:00:08,880
from the classic functional hierarchy

4
00:00:06,799 --> 00:00:10,240
where each person reports to only one

5
00:00:08,880 --> 00:00:12,799
supervisor

6
00:00:10,240 --> 00:00:14,080
to a matrix where people report to both

7
00:00:12,799 --> 00:00:17,119
functional managers

8
00:00:14,080 --> 00:00:18,000
and project managers to a projectized

9
00:00:17,119 --> 00:00:19,840
organization

10
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:22,400
where most of the people work on

11
00:00:19,840 --> 00:00:25,840
projects each of these structures

12
00:00:22,400 --> 00:00:28,400
affects how projects are performed

13
00:00:25,840 --> 00:00:30,240
in a functional hierarchy projects

14
00:00:28,400 --> 00:00:32,320
aren't the priority

15
00:00:30,240 --> 00:00:33,520
making it difficult for projects to

16
00:00:32,320 --> 00:00:35,760
succeed

17
00:00:33,520 --> 00:00:36,960
project managers have almost no

18
00:00:35,760 --> 00:00:39,040
authority

19
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:41,360
a functional manager is typically in

20
00:00:39,040 --> 00:00:43,680
charge of things like the project budget

21
00:00:41,360 --> 00:00:46,000
resources are hard to come by because

22
00:00:43,680 --> 00:00:48,640
they report to functional managers

23
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:50,480
not the project manager even the project

24
00:00:48,640 --> 00:00:50,960
manager and other project management

25
00:00:50,480 --> 00:00:52,960
staff

26
00:00:50,960 --> 00:00:54,239
have to split their attention between

27
00:00:52,960 --> 00:00:57,680
the project and their

28
00:00:54,239 --> 00:01:00,000
regular work the second type

29
00:00:57,680 --> 00:01:01,760
matrix organizations are still

30
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:04,239
functional hierarchies

31
00:01:01,760 --> 00:01:06,000
but they support projects more than pure

32
00:01:04,239 --> 00:01:09,439
hierarchies do

33
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:11,439
they can be weak balanced or strong

34
00:01:09,439 --> 00:01:12,960
depending on how much emphasis they put

35
00:01:11,439 --> 00:01:15,360
on projects

36
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:16,000
in a matrix project managers have some

37
00:01:15,360 --> 00:01:18,960
authority

38
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:19,759
to make decisions resources assigned to

39
00:01:18,960 --> 00:01:22,880
projects

40
00:01:19,759 --> 00:01:23,600
report to two managers their functional

41
00:01:22,880 --> 00:01:26,880
manager

42
00:01:23,600 --> 00:01:28,720
and the project manager in a strong

43
00:01:26,880 --> 00:01:31,920
matrix the project manager

44
00:01:28,720 --> 00:01:36,320
and project admin staff work full time

45
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:39,680
on projects projectized organizations

46
00:01:36,320 --> 00:01:42,399
are all about projects

47
00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:45,600
this third type makes it easier for

48
00:01:42,399 --> 00:01:47,759
project managers to produce results

49
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:49,520
project managers have almost complete

50
00:01:47,759 --> 00:01:52,399
authority over their projects

51
00:01:49,520 --> 00:01:54,079
including the budget resources are

52
00:01:52,399 --> 00:01:56,880
dedicated to project work

53
00:01:54,079 --> 00:01:57,920
and report to the project manager

54
00:01:56,880 --> 00:02:00,640
project managers

55
00:01:57,920 --> 00:02:02,399
and project admin staff also work full

56
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:04,560
time on project work

57
00:02:02,399 --> 00:02:07,360
organizational structure has a big

58
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:09,759
influence on how projects are performed

59
00:02:07,360 --> 00:02:11,520
how much a project manager can do and

60
00:02:09,759 --> 00:02:14,080
how easy it is to make

61
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:15,200
projects successful using these

62
00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:17,760
characteristics

63
00:02:15,200 --> 00:02:19,000
determine which structure your

64
00:02:17,760 --> 00:02:22,000
organization

65
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:22,000
uses
