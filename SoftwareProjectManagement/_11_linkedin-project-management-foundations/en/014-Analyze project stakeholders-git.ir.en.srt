1
00:00:00,700 --> 00:00:06,250
It can be challenging to figure out who the
stakeholders are for your project, which ones

2
00:00:06,250 --> 00:00:11,400
are most important and the best way to work
with them.

3
00:00:11,400 --> 00:00:17,170
That's where the stakeholder analysis document
comes in handy.

4
00:00:17,170 --> 00:00:21,900
You can store information there as you identify
stakeholders and learn about their part in

5
00:00:21,900 --> 00:00:23,970
your project.

6
00:00:23,970 --> 00:00:29,090
Identifying stakeholders and their part in
the project doesn't happen all at once, you'll

7
00:00:29,090 --> 00:00:33,300
figure all that out over the course of defining
the project.

8
00:00:33,300 --> 00:00:39,170
First, you need to know how your stakeholders
are connected to your project and what motivates

9
00:00:39,170 --> 00:00:45,239
them, start by including the department, business
unit or company the stakeholder belongs to

10
00:00:45,239 --> 00:00:47,460
and their position in the organization.

11
00:00:47,460 --> 00:00:52,690
Next, determine who the stakeholder listens
to.

12
00:00:52,690 --> 00:00:56,660
That can help if you need to figure out how
to deal with that stakeholder.

13
00:00:56,660 --> 00:01:03,710
You can ask that person how to handle the
stakeholder or ask them to help directly.

14
00:01:03,710 --> 00:01:09,090
Identify the project objectives that the stakeholder
cares about and how they prioritize those

15
00:01:09,090 --> 00:01:10,359
objectives.

16
00:01:10,359 --> 00:01:16,850
That way, you know which stakeholders to talk
to if an issue comes up with an objective.

17
00:01:16,850 --> 00:01:22,999
Categorize each stakeholder by their influence
and interest in the project that helps you

18
00:01:22,999 --> 00:01:29,310
prioritize stakeholders so you can manage
the time you devote to working with them.

19
00:01:29,310 --> 00:01:34,359
Finally document the stakeholders contributions
to the project, so you know what to expect

20
00:01:34,359 --> 00:01:39,540
from them or who to turn to for things you
need for practice.

21
00:01:39,540 --> 00:01:45,380
Use the stakeholder analysis spreadsheet included
with this course, fill in information about

22
00:01:45,380 --> 00:01:48,799
the stakeholders for one of your own projects.

23
00:01:48,799 --> 00:01:53,700
In addition, the exercise files include a
filled out stakeholder analysis spreadsheet

24
00:01:53,700 --> 00:01:56,999
for the hospital scheduling project.

25
00:01:56,999 --> 00:02:02,539
Keeping stakeholders happy can be overwhelming
and time consuming if you don't know what

26
00:02:02,539 --> 00:02:05,880
they want and how they're involved in your
project.

27
00:02:05,880 --> 00:02:11,430
That's why analyzing your project stakeholders
is a key task during project initiation.
