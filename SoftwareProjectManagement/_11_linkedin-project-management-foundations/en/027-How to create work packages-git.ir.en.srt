1
00:00:00,630 --> 00:00:06,940
A short task name in AWB isn't enough to tell
team members what they're supposed to do to

2
00:00:06,940 --> 00:00:12,800
give your team the info they need, create
work package documents that describe the work

3
00:00:12,800 --> 00:00:19,390
that needs to be done in detail. The level
of detail needed in the work package document

4
00:00:19,390 --> 00:00:24,800
depends on things like how familiar the work
is and the experience of the person assigned

5
00:00:24,800 --> 00:00:31,720
to the task. For example, a work package document
might include a detailed description of the

6
00:00:31,720 --> 00:00:37,500
work for a less experienced person, for someone
more experienced, a checklist of things to

7
00:00:37,500 --> 00:00:43,100
do might be enough. If the specifics of the
work are described somewhere else, you can

8
00:00:43,100 --> 00:00:48,790
refer to the other document that contains
the information. A work package document does

9
00:00:48,790 --> 00:00:55,170
more than describe the work. It also identifies
how, you know, the task is complete and whether

10
00:00:55,170 --> 00:01:01,670
it was completed correctly. For some tasks,
you can include the corresponding deliverable

11
00:01:01,670 --> 00:01:08,200
and success criteria in a work package document.
Otherwise write up a description of what you

12
00:01:08,200 --> 00:01:13,950
will have when the task is complete and what
it should look like. As project manager, you

13
00:01:13,950 --> 00:01:21,280
won't know enough about every aspect of the
work to produce these detailed task descriptions.

14
00:01:21,280 --> 00:01:26,469
Turn to the people who helped you build the
WBC team leaders for the groups that will

15
00:01:26,469 --> 00:01:33,950
work on the project or other knowledgeable
people to help fill in the details. Work packages

16
00:01:33,950 --> 00:01:40,079
help your team members deliver what they're
supposed to for practice, try defining a work

17
00:01:40,079 --> 00:01:45,959
package for the scheduled training task that
appears in the scheduling system WBS.
