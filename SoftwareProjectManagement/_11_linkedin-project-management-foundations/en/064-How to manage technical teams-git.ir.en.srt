1
00:00:00,640 --> 00:00:05,920
technical folks understand technology

2
00:00:03,360 --> 00:00:08,559
inside and out sometimes better than

3
00:00:05,920 --> 00:00:11,920
they seem to understand other people

4
00:00:08,559 --> 00:00:13,920
they're also highly creative so it's no

5
00:00:11,920 --> 00:00:15,759
surprise that managing them

6
00:00:13,920 --> 00:00:17,680
is a little different than managing

7
00:00:15,759 --> 00:00:19,920
other team members

8
00:00:17,680 --> 00:00:20,800
first it's important to help technical

9
00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:22,800
team members

10
00:00:20,800 --> 00:00:23,920
understand the project's business

11
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:26,240
objectives

12
00:00:23,920 --> 00:00:27,439
technical people tend to focus on

13
00:00:26,240 --> 00:00:29,439
technology

14
00:00:27,439 --> 00:00:31,119
they're good at it and it's what they

15
00:00:29,439 --> 00:00:32,800
find interesting

16
00:00:31,119 --> 00:00:35,120
when they understand the business side

17
00:00:32,800 --> 00:00:37,920
of the project they can help identify

18
00:00:35,120 --> 00:00:40,160
potential problems and find solutions

19
00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:42,480
that no one else would think of

20
00:00:40,160 --> 00:00:43,680
technical types often strive for

21
00:00:42,480 --> 00:00:45,600
perfection

22
00:00:43,680 --> 00:00:46,719
they also love to come up with cool

23
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:48,879
solutions

24
00:00:46,719 --> 00:00:50,399
which unfortunately might not be in the

25
00:00:48,879 --> 00:00:52,079
project scope

26
00:00:50,399 --> 00:00:54,000
make sure that the work that they're

27
00:00:52,079 --> 00:00:57,039
doing fits the project's

28
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:59,440
business needs the drive for perfection

29
00:00:57,039 --> 00:01:01,359
can also cause trouble during testing

30
00:00:59,440 --> 00:01:03,600
and fixing defects

31
00:01:01,359 --> 00:01:04,720
while fixing a high priority problem in

32
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:06,720
one area

33
00:01:04,720 --> 00:01:07,760
your technical team members might be

34
00:01:06,720 --> 00:01:10,720
tempted to fix

35
00:01:07,760 --> 00:01:12,080
other issues in the same area that might

36
00:01:10,720 --> 00:01:14,479
be the right thing to do

37
00:01:12,080 --> 00:01:16,240
but you need to make sure before they

38
00:01:14,479 --> 00:01:18,479
dive in

39
00:01:16,240 --> 00:01:20,159
when you manage technical people you

40
00:01:18,479 --> 00:01:23,360
have to juggle your approach

41
00:01:20,159 --> 00:01:23,920
as time goes on early on you need to

42
00:01:23,360 --> 00:01:27,840
give them

43
00:01:23,920 --> 00:01:29,759
space to be creative and explore options

44
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:31,040
the rest of the time you need to keep

45
00:01:29,759 --> 00:01:33,520
them on track

46
00:01:31,040 --> 00:01:34,320
make sure they complete their important

47
00:01:33,520 --> 00:01:37,840
but less

48
00:01:34,320 --> 00:01:39,119
interesting tasks technology can seem

49
00:01:37,840 --> 00:01:42,159
cut and dried

50
00:01:39,119 --> 00:01:44,320
but technical people are creative just

51
00:01:42,159 --> 00:01:46,240
like other types of creative people

52
00:01:44,320 --> 00:01:48,399
technical types work better in

53
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:51,119
particular environments

54
00:01:48,399 --> 00:01:52,960
for example some like to come in late

55
00:01:51,119 --> 00:01:53,840
and work until the wee hours of the

56
00:01:52,960 --> 00:01:56,399
morning

57
00:01:53,840 --> 00:01:57,840
some can't work with any kind of noise

58
00:01:56,399 --> 00:02:01,040
or distraction

59
00:01:57,840 --> 00:02:03,200
while others need music to focus

60
00:02:01,040 --> 00:02:05,439
still others are more productive when

61
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:07,680
they can dress the way they like

62
00:02:05,439 --> 00:02:10,000
try to be flexible enough to give your

63
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:13,680
technical team members the environment

64
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:15,760
that awakens their muse these are a few

65
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:16,959
tips for managing your technical teams

66
00:02:15,760 --> 00:02:19,599
more effectively

67
00:02:16,959 --> 00:02:20,879
for practice develop a solution to the

68
00:02:19,599 --> 00:02:26,000
technical team issue

69
00:02:20,879 --> 00:02:26,000
described in the exercise files
