A big part of project management is planning
out your project in detail. You begin by identifying

2
00:00:07,660 --> 00:00:13,450
the work that must be done to make the project
easy, to manage how you break the work down

3
00:00:13,450 --> 00:00:19,180
into bite sized pieces once you have your
list of tasks. You can start estimating who's

4
00:00:19,180 --> 00:00:26,180
going to do the work, how long each task will
take and how much they'll cost. Figuring out

5
00:00:26,180 --> 00:00:32,550
when things happen requires some special techniques
to build a schedule. You have to take into

6
00:00:32,550 --> 00:00:38,220
account factors like how tasks depend on one
another, how much resources are available

7
00:00:38,220 --> 00:00:44,900
to work on tasks and when those resources
are available. Planning also includes how

8
00:00:44,900 --> 00:00:52,649
you run the project, how will the team communicate
with what tools and how often? You'll also

9
00:00:52,649 --> 00:00:59,980
put together other plans for managing change
and risk and what you'll do to ensure quality,

10
00:00:59,980 --> 00:01:05,980
all of this information goes into a set of
documents that represent the project plan.

11
00:01:05,980 --> 00:01:11,600
The completed project plan doesn't get put
on a shelf to gather dust. You use it over

12
00:01:11,600 --> 00:01:17,340
the life of the project to direct the people
working on your project to keep track of how

13
00:01:17,340 --> 00:01:23,840
the project is going to correct course and
to communicate with stakeholders. Are you

14
00:01:23,840 --> 00:01:31,509
ready to build a project? Plan will explore
each component of a project plan in detail

15
00:01:31,509 --> 00:01:37,270
because a project schedule is a key component
of your plan. An entire chapter is devoted

16
00:01:37,270 --> 00:01:38,530
to how you build one.
