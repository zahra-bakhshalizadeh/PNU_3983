1
00:00:00,799 --> 00:00:04,000
as a project manager you communicate

2
00:00:03,199 --> 00:00:07,120
with people

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:09,440
at all levels of the organization

4
00:00:07,120 --> 00:00:12,480
from the customer and management team to

5
00:00:09,440 --> 00:00:14,960
the people who do project work

6
00:00:12,480 --> 00:00:16,240
communication isn't telling someone

7
00:00:14,960 --> 00:00:18,400
something

8
00:00:16,240 --> 00:00:19,600
it's about getting a message across so

9
00:00:18,400 --> 00:00:22,000
the other person

10
00:00:19,600 --> 00:00:23,760
understands it and does something about

11
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:27,119
it

12
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:29,519
good communication skills are key

13
00:00:27,119 --> 00:00:30,320
with them you and your team will get

14
00:00:29,519 --> 00:00:34,000
more

15
00:00:30,320 --> 00:00:36,000
and better work done first

16
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:37,280
tell your audience why they should pay

17
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:40,719
attention

18
00:00:37,280 --> 00:00:43,040
second get to the point that way

19
00:00:40,719 --> 00:00:44,320
you'll make your point before they lose

20
00:00:43,040 --> 00:00:47,120
interest

21
00:00:44,320 --> 00:00:48,239
third tailor your message to your

22
00:00:47,120 --> 00:00:51,199
audience

23
00:00:48,239 --> 00:00:52,800
what's relevant to them use terms they

24
00:00:51,199 --> 00:00:55,039
understand

25
00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:56,079
i managed a project where the client

26
00:00:55,039 --> 00:00:59,039
wanted a lot

27
00:00:56,079 --> 00:01:01,680
and they wanted it quickly the team was

28
00:00:59,039 --> 00:01:04,159
overworked and exhausted

29
00:01:01,680 --> 00:01:06,560
at meetings management focused on

30
00:01:04,159 --> 00:01:07,840
projected sales and revenue from the

31
00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:09,760
project

32
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:12,159
team members just slumped in their

33
00:01:09,760 --> 00:01:15,439
chairs because all they heard was

34
00:01:12,159 --> 00:01:17,680
we want you to do even more work

35
00:01:15,439 --> 00:01:19,360
when i talked to the team i focused on

36
00:01:17,680 --> 00:01:22,799
how the project would benefit

37
00:01:19,360 --> 00:01:26,960
them they perked up hearing that

38
00:01:22,799 --> 00:01:31,759
and we did make the project a success

39
00:01:26,960 --> 00:01:34,000
fourth be positive and proactive

40
00:01:31,759 --> 00:01:35,520
if you have to discuss a problem

41
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:38,960
describe what it is

42
00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:41,040
and then explain your plan to handle it

43
00:01:38,960 --> 00:01:43,040
here are some other tips for improving

44
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:46,960
communication

45
00:01:43,040 --> 00:01:49,680
listening is as important as talking

46
00:01:46,960 --> 00:01:50,880
when you're the audience pay attention

47
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:54,240
no cell phones

48
00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:56,159
no text messages no emails

49
00:01:54,240 --> 00:01:57,439
i know it's tough but it's worth

50
00:01:56,159 --> 00:02:00,560
practicing

51
00:01:57,439 --> 00:02:03,680
you'll get a lot more done

52
00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:06,840
watch for unspoken communication

53
00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:08,560
think body language and facial

54
00:02:06,840 --> 00:02:10,800
expressions

55
00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:12,959
on the phone listen for intonations in

56
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:15,280
someone's voice

57
00:02:12,959 --> 00:02:16,959
when you have difficult delicate or

58
00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:20,239
crucial messages

59
00:02:16,959 --> 00:02:23,520
choose face-to-face meetings that way

60
00:02:20,239 --> 00:02:25,360
everyone can receive spoken and unspoken

61
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:29,200
messages

62
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:31,120
keep an open mind conversations or

63
00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:32,400
meetings are a waste if you

64
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:34,239
aren't going to listen to what other

65
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:37,040
people say

66
00:02:34,239 --> 00:02:39,200
paraphrase what you've heard or ask the

67
00:02:37,040 --> 00:02:41,519
other person to do that

68
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:42,879
by putting information in your own words

69
00:02:41,519 --> 00:02:45,360
you demonstrate that you

70
00:02:42,879 --> 00:02:48,959
do understand and give the other person

71
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:53,200
a chance to correct you if necessary

72
00:02:48,959 --> 00:02:56,080
finally use email effectively

73
00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:57,840
take time to write a clear message it

74
00:02:56,080 --> 00:03:01,440
will actually save time

75
00:02:57,840 --> 00:03:04,480
by reducing back and forth email volleys

76
00:03:01,440 --> 00:03:06,720
make subject lines meaningful if you're

77
00:03:04,480 --> 00:03:09,599
asking for action and have a deadline

78
00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:11,519
put them right in the subject start with

79
00:03:09,599 --> 00:03:13,840
the point

80
00:03:11,519 --> 00:03:14,959
start with what you want and what's

81
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:18,080
important

82
00:03:14,959 --> 00:03:21,360
and then backfill with the detail

83
00:03:18,080 --> 00:03:24,480
a good email is like a newspaper article

84
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:27,200
you get the key info right up front

85
00:03:24,480 --> 00:03:29,599
before you click send don't forget to

86
00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:31,280
proofread your messages

87
00:03:29,599 --> 00:03:32,720
spelling or editing mistakes and

88
00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:34,400
grammatical errors can

89
00:03:32,720 --> 00:03:38,400
radically change the meaning of a

90
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:40,799
message confirm that your emails arrive

91
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:41,920
if you don't get a response follow up

92
00:03:40,799 --> 00:03:45,120
with an email

93
00:03:41,920 --> 00:03:47,840
call or visit finally

94
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:49,760
be careful with humor it doesn't work so

95
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:52,400
well in email

96
00:03:49,760 --> 00:03:55,040
use it only with people you know well

97
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:57,760
and let them know you're doing it

98
00:03:55,040 --> 00:03:58,560
for practice put together communication

99
00:03:57,760 --> 00:04:03,439
guidelines

100
00:03:58,560 --> 00:04:03,439
you might give to your project team
