1
00:00:00,719 --> 00:00:03,520
when your project's deliverables are

2
00:00:02,560 --> 00:00:06,560
complete

3
00:00:03,520 --> 00:00:08,880
you might think the project is finished

4
00:00:06,560 --> 00:00:12,160
but you have a few activities to perform

5
00:00:08,880 --> 00:00:14,880
before you can call the project done

6
00:00:12,160 --> 00:00:16,480
the most important part of closing is

7
00:00:14,880 --> 00:00:20,000
getting the customer to agree

8
00:00:16,480 --> 00:00:24,000
that the project completed successfully

9
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:25,840
you want to get acceptance in writing

10
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:28,160
the best way to do that is to hold a

11
00:00:25,840 --> 00:00:28,480
meeting so the customer and stakeholders

12
00:00:28,160 --> 00:00:31,439
can

13
00:00:28,480 --> 00:00:32,399
sign the acceptance form the next

14
00:00:31,439 --> 00:00:35,280
closing step

15
00:00:32,399 --> 00:00:36,640
is to document lessons learned during

16
00:00:35,280 --> 00:00:38,640
the project

17
00:00:36,640 --> 00:00:39,920
you can improve the performance of

18
00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:42,640
future projects

19
00:00:39,920 --> 00:00:43,760
by identifying what worked well what

20
00:00:42,640 --> 00:00:47,760
didn't

21
00:00:43,760 --> 00:00:50,000
and how things can be done better third

22
00:00:47,760 --> 00:00:51,440
produce final documentation and a

23
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:54,399
closeout report that

24
00:00:51,440 --> 00:00:56,320
sums up the project's performance

25
00:00:54,399 --> 00:00:58,640
finally it's time to close

26
00:00:56,320 --> 00:00:59,680
contracts archive your project

27
00:00:58,640 --> 00:01:01,760
information

28
00:00:59,680 --> 00:01:03,920
and transition your team to their next

29
00:01:01,760 --> 00:01:06,640
assignments

30
00:01:03,920 --> 00:01:07,840
in this chapter i'll describe each of

31
00:01:06,640 --> 00:01:11,680
these activities

32
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:11,680
