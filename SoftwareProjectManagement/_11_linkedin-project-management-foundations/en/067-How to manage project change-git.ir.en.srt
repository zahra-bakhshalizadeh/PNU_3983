1
00:00:00,560 --> 00:00:04,640
during planning you built a change

2
00:00:02,800 --> 00:00:07,600
management plan that describes

3
00:00:04,640 --> 00:00:08,960
how to handle project changes now the

4
00:00:07,600 --> 00:00:12,160
project is underway

5
00:00:08,960 --> 00:00:14,639
it's time to put that plan to work

6
00:00:12,160 --> 00:00:17,359
let's say a change request comes in you

7
00:00:14,639 --> 00:00:19,680
assign someone to evaluate the request

8
00:00:17,359 --> 00:00:22,160
add it to the change request log and

9
00:00:19,680 --> 00:00:24,480
submit it to the change review board

10
00:00:22,160 --> 00:00:26,480
along with your recommendation to either

11
00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:28,960
approve or reject it

12
00:00:26,480 --> 00:00:30,560
if the request is rejected let the

13
00:00:28,960 --> 00:00:32,480
requester know

14
00:00:30,560 --> 00:00:34,880
make sure no one on the team starts

15
00:00:32,480 --> 00:00:36,239
working on it in anticipation of its

16
00:00:34,880 --> 00:00:39,040
approval

17
00:00:36,239 --> 00:00:39,520
however if the request is approved you

18
00:00:39,040 --> 00:00:42,399
assign

19
00:00:39,520 --> 00:00:44,160
someone to keep an eye on it that person

20
00:00:42,399 --> 00:00:45,680
updates the baseline documents to

21
00:00:44,160 --> 00:00:47,920
reflect the change

22
00:00:45,680 --> 00:00:49,760
maybe new tasks are needed or the

23
00:00:47,920 --> 00:00:53,600
project finish date moves

24
00:00:49,760 --> 00:00:56,000
or cost increases tag baseline document

25
00:00:53,600 --> 00:00:58,000
edits with the change request number

26
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:00,640
that way it's easy to see where

27
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:02,879
modifications came from

28
00:01:00,640 --> 00:01:05,600
the owner of the change request also

29
00:01:02,879 --> 00:01:08,000
adds status to the change request log

30
00:01:05,600 --> 00:01:08,799
reports on progress and shepherds the

31
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:11,760
request

32
00:01:08,799 --> 00:01:12,560
through to completion at that point the

33
00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:15,200
owner makes

34
00:01:12,560 --> 00:01:16,000
one last update in the change request

35
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:18,799
log

36
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:20,000
to show the actual hours cost and

37
00:01:18,799 --> 00:01:23,680
project finish date

38
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:25,280
if it's changed what if a change request

39
00:01:23,680 --> 00:01:28,400
has a big impact

40
00:01:25,280 --> 00:01:29,520
i mean really big the change request

41
00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:32,320
board's authority

42
00:01:29,520 --> 00:01:34,159
does have limits here are a couple of

43
00:01:32,320 --> 00:01:36,000
exceptions to the change request

44
00:01:34,159 --> 00:01:38,240
approval process

45
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:40,159
suppose a change request affects the

46
00:01:38,240 --> 00:01:42,880
project's business case

47
00:01:40,159 --> 00:01:44,880
in that situation the customer needs to

48
00:01:42,880 --> 00:01:46,720
approve the change request

49
00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:49,119
if a change request affects other

50
00:01:46,720 --> 00:01:51,280
projects take the request to your

51
00:01:49,119 --> 00:01:52,640
organization's executive board for

52
00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:55,520
approval

53
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:56,960
emergencies are another special case

54
00:01:55,520 --> 00:01:59,040
when a change request

55
00:01:56,960 --> 00:02:00,000
can't wait for the next change review

56
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:02,719
board meeting

57
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:05,119
you need to act fast think about getting

58
00:02:02,719 --> 00:02:07,280
an emergency review board meeting

59
00:02:05,119 --> 00:02:09,840
or you can ask the customer or sponsor

60
00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:12,879
to approve the request

61
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:15,040
change is a fact of project life

62
00:02:12,879 --> 00:02:17,200
by managing change requests you can

63
00:02:15,040 --> 00:02:20,319
approve the ones that make sense

64
00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:21,200
and keep your project on track for

65
00:02:20,319 --> 00:02:23,120
practice

66
00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:24,239
describe what you would do for the

67
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:29,200
change request

68
00:02:24,239 --> 00:02:29,200
