1
00:00:00,799 --> 00:00:04,080
the critical path is the longest

2
00:00:02,879 --> 00:00:06,879
sequence of tasks

3
00:00:04,080 --> 00:00:07,359
in your schedule why is the critical

4
00:00:06,879 --> 00:00:11,200
path

5
00:00:07,359 --> 00:00:11,679
so critical because any delay on that

6
00:00:11,200 --> 00:00:15,040
path

7
00:00:11,679 --> 00:00:17,039
delays the finish date of the project

8
00:00:15,040 --> 00:00:18,880
just as important if you can figure out

9
00:00:17,039 --> 00:00:22,000
how to shorten the critical path

10
00:00:18,880 --> 00:00:22,880
you can shorten the project schedule how

11
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:25,279
do you tell

12
00:00:22,880 --> 00:00:26,000
which tasks are on the critical path

13
00:00:25,279 --> 00:00:29,119
simple

14
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:32,399
they don't have any slack also known as

15
00:00:29,119 --> 00:00:34,880
float just like a string with no slack

16
00:00:32,399 --> 00:00:37,760
critical tasks can't move without

17
00:00:34,880 --> 00:00:40,239
affecting the project finish date

18
00:00:37,760 --> 00:00:41,280
in this simple example the system and

19
00:00:40,239 --> 00:00:45,280
training tasks

20
00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:47,280
occur one after the other with no slack

21
00:00:45,280 --> 00:00:50,559
if any of these tasks are delayed the

22
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:54,000
project finish date moves later in time

23
00:00:50,559 --> 00:00:57,120
on the other hand if a task has slack

24
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:58,000
like the reports task here it can start

25
00:00:57,120 --> 00:01:01,199
later without

26
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:03,600
delaying the tasks that come after it

27
00:01:01,199 --> 00:01:05,760
the reports task could delay by a few

28
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:07,840
weeks before it delays the project

29
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:10,080
finish

30
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:13,040
let's look at how you tell whether or

31
00:01:10,080 --> 00:01:15,759
not a task has slack

32
00:01:13,040 --> 00:01:17,119
a task has two sets of start and finish

33
00:01:15,759 --> 00:01:19,680
dates

34
00:01:17,119 --> 00:01:22,080
the early start and early finish are the

35
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:23,520
earliest possible dates the tasks can

36
00:01:22,080 --> 00:01:25,439
start or finish

37
00:01:23,520 --> 00:01:27,200
based on its dependencies with other

38
00:01:25,439 --> 00:01:30,320
tasks

39
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:33,759
you calculate these with what's called

40
00:01:30,320 --> 00:01:35,360
a forward pass that's where you start at

41
00:01:33,759 --> 00:01:37,840
the project start date

42
00:01:35,360 --> 00:01:38,880
and use task durations and dependencies

43
00:01:37,840 --> 00:01:42,159
to calculate

44
00:01:38,880 --> 00:01:44,799
when they finish for example

45
00:01:42,159 --> 00:01:46,720
the reports task can start as early as

46
00:01:44,799 --> 00:01:49,840
october 26th

47
00:01:46,720 --> 00:01:52,079
and finish on november 27th

48
00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:53,600
the late start and late finish are the

49
00:01:52,079 --> 00:01:56,799
latest possible dates

50
00:01:53,600 --> 00:01:58,799
without delaying tasks that follow

51
00:01:56,799 --> 00:02:01,840
you calculate these dates by working

52
00:01:58,799 --> 00:02:05,280
backwards from the end of the project

53
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:07,680
you got it the backward pass

54
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:09,360
the late finish for the reports task is

55
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:12,080
december 18th

56
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:14,640
so working backwards the late start is

57
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:17,280
november 16th

58
00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:18,239
the task has several weeks of slack so

59
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:21,440
it isn't

60
00:02:18,239 --> 00:02:24,480
on the critical path critical tasks have

61
00:02:21,440 --> 00:02:26,560
no slack in other words the early and

62
00:02:24,480 --> 00:02:28,720
late dates are the same

63
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:30,480
that's why the training task is on the

64
00:02:28,720 --> 00:02:33,280
critical path

65
00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:35,200
the good news you don't have to perform

66
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:37,680
these calculations

67
00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:39,760
when you use project scheduling programs

68
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:43,040
they calculate the critical path

69
00:02:39,760 --> 00:02:45,200
for you the critical path

70
00:02:43,040 --> 00:02:46,160
is the place to look when you want to

71
00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:49,519
keep your project

72
00:02:46,160 --> 00:02:52,560
on time or deliver it early

73
00:02:49,519 --> 00:02:55,440
to test your understanding calculate the

74
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:58,080
late dates for the tasks in the exercise

75
00:02:55,440 --> 00:03:00,959
and use them to identify the critical

76
00:02:58,080 --> 00:03:00,959
path
