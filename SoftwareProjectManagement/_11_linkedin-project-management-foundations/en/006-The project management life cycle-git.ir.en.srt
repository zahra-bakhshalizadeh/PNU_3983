1
00:00:00,640 --> 00:00:03,360
project management can be categorized

2
00:00:02,879 --> 00:00:05,839
into

3
00:00:03,360 --> 00:00:07,359
five groups of processes that help guide

4
00:00:05,839 --> 00:00:10,240
a project successfully

5
00:00:07,359 --> 00:00:12,160
from beginning to end here are project

6
00:00:10,240 --> 00:00:14,000
management's five process groups

7
00:00:12,160 --> 00:00:15,679
according to the project management

8
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:18,320
institute

9
00:00:15,679 --> 00:00:20,640
initiating is all about getting the

10
00:00:18,320 --> 00:00:22,960
commitment to start a project

11
00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:24,720
to get that commitment you start by

12
00:00:22,960 --> 00:00:26,080
defining the project

13
00:00:24,720 --> 00:00:28,960
what's the project supposed to

14
00:00:26,080 --> 00:00:31,039
accomplish what's the scope

15
00:00:28,960 --> 00:00:32,880
what's a rough estimate of the resources

16
00:00:31,039 --> 00:00:34,399
needed and the cost

17
00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:37,440
you also identify the project

18
00:00:34,399 --> 00:00:40,719
stakeholders and make sure they agree on

19
00:00:37,440 --> 00:00:44,000
what the project is from there you

20
00:00:40,719 --> 00:00:46,640
ask for approval to proceed

21
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:49,039
planning is where you figure out how

22
00:00:46,640 --> 00:00:51,039
you're going to perform the project

23
00:00:49,039 --> 00:00:52,079
in essence planning answers the

24
00:00:51,039 --> 00:00:54,640
questions

25
00:00:52,079 --> 00:00:55,680
what are we going to do how are we going

26
00:00:54,640 --> 00:00:58,800
to do it

27
00:00:55,680 --> 00:01:00,960
and how will we know when we're done

28
00:00:58,800 --> 00:01:04,159
when the plan is complete it's time to

29
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:06,400
get approval to launch the project

30
00:01:04,159 --> 00:01:08,479
the next two areas involve putting your

31
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:10,840
plan into action

32
00:01:08,479 --> 00:01:12,240
executing starts with launching a

33
00:01:10,840 --> 00:01:15,040
project

34
00:01:12,240 --> 00:01:16,479
you bring your resources on board get

35
00:01:15,040 --> 00:01:18,560
them settled in

36
00:01:16,479 --> 00:01:19,920
and explain the rules you're using to

37
00:01:18,560 --> 00:01:22,640
run the project

38
00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:23,119
after that everyone jumps in to put the

39
00:01:22,640 --> 00:01:26,799
plan

40
00:01:23,119 --> 00:01:27,520
into action monitoring and controlling a

41
00:01:26,799 --> 00:01:29,759
project

42
00:01:27,520 --> 00:01:30,720
means checking what's going on in the

43
00:01:29,759 --> 00:01:32,400
project

44
00:01:30,720 --> 00:01:35,439
and how that compares to what you

45
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:38,560
planned if the project is sliding

46
00:01:35,439 --> 00:01:40,640
off track you take action to get it back

47
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:44,560
on course

48
00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:48,079
finally there's the closing process

49
00:01:44,560 --> 00:01:50,399
this part is short but important

50
00:01:48,079 --> 00:01:52,399
you get the client to officially accept

51
00:01:50,399 --> 00:01:54,799
that the project is complete

52
00:01:52,399 --> 00:01:56,320
you document the project performance

53
00:01:54,799 --> 00:01:59,520
gather lessons learned

54
00:01:56,320 --> 00:02:02,159
close contracts and help resources move

55
00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:04,159
on to their next assignments

56
00:02:02,159 --> 00:02:06,079
those are the five process groups that

57
00:02:04,159 --> 00:02:07,119
represent the project management life

58
00:02:06,079 --> 00:02:09,280
cycle

59
00:02:07,119 --> 00:02:10,560
put these processes into action

60
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:16,160
consistently

61
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:16,160
and your projects will run more smoothly
