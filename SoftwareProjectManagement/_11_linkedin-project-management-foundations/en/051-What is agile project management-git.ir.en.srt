1
00:00:00,640 --> 00:00:03,840
agile projects are great when business

2
00:00:03,280 --> 00:00:06,319
needs

3
00:00:03,840 --> 00:00:07,120
change frequently or the business wants

4
00:00:06,319 --> 00:00:10,400
to receive

5
00:00:07,120 --> 00:00:11,679
value sooner agile does this by

6
00:00:10,400 --> 00:00:13,840
frequently delivering

7
00:00:11,679 --> 00:00:15,440
small chunks of a product known as

8
00:00:13,840 --> 00:00:17,600
features

9
00:00:15,440 --> 00:00:19,760
this steady release of deliverables

10
00:00:17,600 --> 00:00:22,560
requires a different approach

11
00:00:19,760 --> 00:00:23,760
to managing and implementing work you

12
00:00:22,560 --> 00:00:27,599
guessed it

13
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:29,840
agile project management with agile

14
00:00:27,599 --> 00:00:31,760
work is performed in time periods called

15
00:00:29,840 --> 00:00:34,960
iterations or sprints

16
00:00:31,760 --> 00:00:37,600
they typically last 2 to 12 weeks

17
00:00:34,960 --> 00:00:38,960
the goal of each iteration is to deliver

18
00:00:37,600 --> 00:00:42,079
a complete

19
00:00:38,960 --> 00:00:43,600
ready to use feature that's how value is

20
00:00:42,079 --> 00:00:45,520
delivered sooner

21
00:00:43,600 --> 00:00:47,039
and if business needs change you can

22
00:00:45,520 --> 00:00:50,559
address that in a later

23
00:00:47,039 --> 00:00:51,520
iteration agile places more importance

24
00:00:50,559 --> 00:00:54,559
on people and

25
00:00:51,520 --> 00:00:56,719
interaction than processes and tools

26
00:00:54,559 --> 00:00:58,239
for example people communicate when

27
00:00:56,719 --> 00:01:00,640
there's a reason to

28
00:00:58,239 --> 00:01:01,600
not because the weekly team meeting is

29
00:01:00,640 --> 00:01:03,920
scheduled

30
00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:06,000
to facilitate interaction business and

31
00:01:03,920 --> 00:01:07,280
technical team members work in the same

32
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:09,600
location

33
00:01:07,280 --> 00:01:11,200
or use collaboration tools to achieve

34
00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:14,240
the same effect

35
00:01:11,200 --> 00:01:15,200
with agile your goal is to produce a

36
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:18,479
product

37
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:19,119
not reams of documentation that doesn't

38
00:01:18,479 --> 00:01:21,680
mean

39
00:01:19,119 --> 00:01:22,799
no documentation while the team is

40
00:01:21,680 --> 00:01:25,280
building features

41
00:01:22,799 --> 00:01:26,000
documentation is limited to what they

42
00:01:25,280 --> 00:01:28,560
need to do

43
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:31,200
their work documentation like user

44
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:33,920
guides are added to the features list

45
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:35,360
the customer is much more engaged in an

46
00:01:33,920 --> 00:01:37,360
agile project

47
00:01:35,360 --> 00:01:39,040
in the waterfall approach the customer

48
00:01:37,360 --> 00:01:41,280
negotiates requirements

49
00:01:39,040 --> 00:01:42,560
front and then waits for the end

50
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:45,280
deliverables

51
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:47,920
in agile the customer collaborates

52
00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:50,320
throughout the development process

53
00:01:47,920 --> 00:01:51,759
which means it's easier to meet their

54
00:01:50,320 --> 00:01:54,560
needs

55
00:01:51,759 --> 00:01:55,759
changes are not only expected but

56
00:01:54,560 --> 00:01:58,960
welcomed

57
00:01:55,759 --> 00:02:00,399
the agile philosophy views change as a

58
00:01:58,960 --> 00:02:03,759
way to provide

59
00:02:00,399 --> 00:02:05,759
more value with agile you can shift

60
00:02:03,759 --> 00:02:08,959
priorities quickly by adding new

61
00:02:05,759 --> 00:02:10,879
features in a later iteration

62
00:02:08,959 --> 00:02:12,800
agile performs many of the same

63
00:02:10,879 --> 00:02:13,760
activities in waterfall project

64
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:16,720
management

65
00:02:13,760 --> 00:02:17,680
in a slightly different order one way to

66
00:02:16,720 --> 00:02:19,920
think about it

67
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:20,879
the waterfall approach defines the scope

68
00:02:19,920 --> 00:02:23,520
of the project

69
00:02:20,879 --> 00:02:26,000
and then estimates the time cost and

70
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:29,120
quality to deliver that scope

71
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:32,160
agile looks at time cost and quality as

72
00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:33,599
fixed elements then you figure out which

73
00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:36,480
features you can produce

74
00:02:33,599 --> 00:02:38,480
given those constraints the agile

75
00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:40,640
methodology described in this chapter

76
00:02:38,480 --> 00:02:42,480
starts with the envision stage

77
00:02:40,640 --> 00:02:44,560
where you define the goal and the

78
00:02:42,480 --> 00:02:47,200
boundaries of the project

79
00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:48,640
you then repeat the speculate explore

80
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:51,280
and adapt stages

81
00:02:48,640 --> 00:02:53,360
to develop and test features at the end

82
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:54,000
of the project you perform a closing

83
00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:58,000
stage

84
00:02:54,000 --> 00:03:00,480
once to wrap things up change control is

85
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:01,680
done by prioritizing the backlog of

86
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:04,159
features

87
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:05,360
and risk is managed with frequent

88
00:03:04,159 --> 00:03:07,599
releases

89
00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:09,200
if you're familiar with agile you might

90
00:03:07,599 --> 00:03:12,879
think agile means

91
00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:15,280
it projects it turns out agile works

92
00:03:12,879 --> 00:03:17,680
with non-it projects too

93
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:19,040
as long as deliverables can be produced

94
00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:21,840
and implemented in

95
00:03:19,040 --> 00:03:23,360
short periods and can be added to in the

96
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:25,360
future

97
00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:26,799
agile works well for projects with

98
00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:29,920
changing business needs

99
00:03:26,799 --> 00:03:31,360
or a desire to produce value quickly if

100
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:33,519
you want to practice

101
00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:35,680
identify portions of the hospital

102
00:03:33,519 --> 00:03:40,000
scheduling project that could benefit

103
00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:40,000
from an agile approach
