00:00:05,690 --> 00:00:11,880
One issue identified in this chapter is that
delays in the vendor procurement process have

2
00:00:11,880 --> 00:00:17,820
delayed the project finished date past the
grant expiration date. This is a top priority

3
00:00:17,820 --> 00:00:23,080
issue because the grant money covers most
of the expenses for the hospital scheduling

4
00:00:23,080 --> 00:00:28,990
system. One solution to this problem shows
promise. Your sponsor and the Change Review

5
00:00:28,990 --> 00:00:35,090
Board have approved the change request for
the vendor to perform the work for this solution.

6
00:00:35,090 --> 00:00:42,660
The change request is available in the exercise
files. You have created a schedule, budget,

7
00:00:42,660 --> 00:00:50,989
resource plan, risk plan, communication plan
and quality plan for the project in this challenge,

8
00:00:50,989 --> 00:00:57,469
determine which of these tools and plans need
to be updated for this change request. Provide

9
00:00:57,469 --> 00:01:04,159
an overview of the changes that need to be
made. Take about 20 minutes for this challenge.

10
00:01:04,159 --> 00:01:08,440
After you complete the challenge, you can
head to the exercise files to take a look

11
00:01:08,440 --> 00:01:09,619
at my solution.
