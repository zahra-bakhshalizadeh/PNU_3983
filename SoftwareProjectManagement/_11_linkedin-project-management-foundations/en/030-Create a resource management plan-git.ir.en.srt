1
00:00:00,680 --> 00:00:07,169
Part of planning is to identify and document
project roles and responsibilities, who reports

2
00:00:07,169 --> 00:00:14,430
to whom and the skills needed to do the project
work. So that's where the resource management

3
00:00:14,430 --> 00:00:21,390
plan comes into play. This plan also includes
a staffing plan which describes everything

4
00:00:21,390 --> 00:00:28,650
about how you'll staff the project. He start
with a responsibility matrix, this document

5
00:00:28,650 --> 00:00:35,390
spells out who can make or approved decisions,
the groups performing work and which groups

6
00:00:35,390 --> 00:00:42,500
need to be consulted or informed about what's
going on. A responsibility matrix includes

7
00:00:42,500 --> 00:00:50,140
four categories of responsibility, our means
a group is responsible for performing work,

8
00:00:50,140 --> 00:00:58,160
I represents inform, which means a group gets
information. See means that you consult a

9
00:00:58,160 --> 00:01:05,129
group about decisions, however, they aren't
accountable for the decision that's made.

10
00:01:05,129 --> 00:01:11,710
A is for accountable, which means the group
makes or approves decisions and delegates

11
00:01:11,710 --> 00:01:18,750
work. During planning review, the responsibility
matrix with stakeholders and work out any

12
00:01:18,750 --> 00:01:25,040
disagreements if part of your project doesn't
have an owner, meaning someone accountable

13
00:01:25,040 --> 00:01:31,710
for that area, talk to the stakeholders and
your project sponsor to identify who is accountable

14
00:01:31,710 --> 00:01:39,030
for that area. You might have outsourcing,
subcontracting and partnering arrangements,

15
00:01:39,030 --> 00:01:45,850
don't forget to add these groups and how they
contribute to the responsibility matrix. The

16
00:01:45,850 --> 00:01:52,670
second part of a resource management plan
is a project organization chart. It's like

17
00:01:52,670 --> 00:01:59,159
a regular org chart, except it shows the hierarchy
and reporting structure for people involved

18
00:01:59,159 --> 00:02:06,130
with the project, that way you know who to
talk to if you need to escalate a request

19
00:02:06,130 --> 00:02:07,659
or decision.

20
00:02:07,659 --> 00:02:14,980
Third, identify the skills the project requires
and how many people you need with those skills,

21
00:02:14,980 --> 00:02:21,499
a skills matrix helps you figure this out.
To build one, take a look at your work packages

22
00:02:21,499 --> 00:02:28,340
and identify the skills each package requires,
then create a matrix with your project tasks

23
00:02:28,340 --> 00:02:36,299
in rows and the skills you need in the columns
at checkboxes in the Matrix when tasks require

24
00:02:36,299 --> 00:02:43,409
a specific skill. Then you estimate the number
of resources you need with each skill, you

25
00:02:43,409 --> 00:02:49,980
can even multiply that number by the average
pay rate to estimate the labor cost. Finally,

26
00:02:49,980 --> 00:02:57,919
it's time to develop the detailed staffing
plan, identify where you plan to get resources,

27
00:02:57,919 --> 00:03:05,799
are they in-house, outsourced or contracted?
When do you need resources, identify any training

28
00:03:05,799 --> 00:03:13,760
they need and document resource related processes,
getting team members on board, handing out

29
00:03:13,760 --> 00:03:21,260
assignments, getting status updates and releasing
them from the project when their work is done.

30
00:03:21,260 --> 00:03:27,889
A resource management plan documents who does
what, who reports to whom the resources you

31
00:03:27,889 --> 00:03:34,540
need and how you'll manage them as an exercise.
Use what you know about the project so far

32
00:03:34,540 --> 00:03:41,120
to complete the responsibility matrix in the
exercise files. Then using your responsibility

33
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:45,400
metrics, draw up a project organization chart.
