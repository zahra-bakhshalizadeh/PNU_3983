1
00:00:00,640 --> 00:00:04,160
when work is underway you have to look

2
00:00:02,720 --> 00:00:07,120
at the schedule and cost

3
00:00:04,160 --> 00:00:09,040
to see where the project stands start

4
00:00:07,120 --> 00:00:10,080
with a gantt chart that compares the

5
00:00:09,040 --> 00:00:13,120
current schedule

6
00:00:10,080 --> 00:00:14,960
to your baseline plan the position of

7
00:00:13,120 --> 00:00:17,840
the taskbars in the time scale

8
00:00:14,960 --> 00:00:18,160
shows whether tasks are ahead of behind

9
00:00:17,840 --> 00:00:21,039
or

10
00:00:18,160 --> 00:00:23,199
right on schedule in this example the

11
00:00:21,039 --> 00:00:25,760
current taskbars for implementation

12
00:00:23,199 --> 00:00:28,240
are scheduled later than the baseline so

13
00:00:25,760 --> 00:00:30,560
they're behind schedule

14
00:00:28,240 --> 00:00:32,239
variance values show the exact

15
00:00:30,560 --> 00:00:34,480
difference between your baseline

16
00:00:32,239 --> 00:00:36,320
and current schedule the finished

17
00:00:34,480 --> 00:00:40,000
variance in this example

18
00:00:36,320 --> 00:00:41,920
is negative 25 days you would have to

19
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:45,440
shorten the remaining schedule by

20
00:00:41,920 --> 00:00:47,680
25 days to get it back on track

21
00:00:45,440 --> 00:00:49,760
homing in on problem tasks helps you

22
00:00:47,680 --> 00:00:52,239
identify what you need to change

23
00:00:49,760 --> 00:00:54,000
to keep your schedule on track

24
00:00:52,239 --> 00:00:56,840
scheduling programs include

25
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:59,039
tools that provide early warning of

26
00:00:56,840 --> 00:01:01,359
delays for example

27
00:00:59,039 --> 00:01:03,440
look for incomplete tasks that are

28
00:01:01,359 --> 00:01:05,760
running behind schedule

29
00:01:03,440 --> 00:01:06,640
or tasks that should have started but

30
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:09,200
haven't

31
00:01:06,640 --> 00:01:11,040
or tasks where work hours are behind

32
00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:13,040
schedule

33
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:15,200
in addition to the schedule you also

34
00:01:13,040 --> 00:01:18,240
need to compare project costs

35
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:21,119
to what was budgeted cost variances

36
00:01:18,240 --> 00:01:22,159
are perfect for that if the project is

37
00:01:21,119 --> 00:01:25,360
over budget

38
00:01:22,159 --> 00:01:26,000
you need to find out why maybe scope

39
00:01:25,360 --> 00:01:29,119
creep is to

40
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:30,240
blame work was done without adding

41
00:01:29,119 --> 00:01:32,640
budget for it

42
00:01:30,240 --> 00:01:35,600
or tasks may be taking longer than plans

43
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:39,119
so labor costs are higher

44
00:01:35,600 --> 00:01:41,840
work might be going faster than planned

45
00:01:39,119 --> 00:01:44,000
that incurs cost faster so it looks like

46
00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:45,920
it's over budget at that point

47
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:48,000
if the work required follows your

48
00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:51,600
estimate the cost at the end

49
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:53,759
will be back within budget once you see

50
00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:56,320
where the project stands and identify

51
00:01:53,759 --> 00:01:58,880
problems you'll have the info you need

52
00:01:56,320 --> 00:02:01,040
to come up with solutions

53
00:01:58,880 --> 00:02:02,640
take a look at the project schedule and

54
00:02:01,040 --> 00:02:05,520
costs in the exercise

55
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:09,280
files and identify issues you might need

56
00:02:05,520 --> 00:02:09,280
to address
