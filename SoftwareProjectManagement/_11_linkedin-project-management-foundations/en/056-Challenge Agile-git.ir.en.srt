00:00:05,680 --> 00:00:09,200
in this challenge

3
00:00:06,960 --> 00:00:11,120
you want to leverage agile approaches

4
00:00:09,200 --> 00:00:13,280
for the hospital scheduling project

5
00:00:11,120 --> 00:00:15,440
wherever possible

6
00:00:13,280 --> 00:00:16,800
to help identify project areas that

7
00:00:15,440 --> 00:00:18,560
might work for agile

8
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:20,240
you and your team have done some

9
00:00:18,560 --> 00:00:22,560
research

10
00:00:20,240 --> 00:00:24,160
use the research results in the exercise

11
00:00:22,560 --> 00:00:26,400
files to determine

12
00:00:24,160 --> 00:00:27,680
how well agile methods would work on the

13
00:00:26,400 --> 00:00:31,119
scheduling system

14
00:00:27,680 --> 00:00:33,600
for each area of the hospital take about

15
00:00:31,119 --> 00:00:35,200
10 minutes to identify your agile

16
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:37,040
candidates

17
00:00:35,200 --> 00:00:38,640
after you identify the sections you

18
00:00:37,040 --> 00:00:41,719
would select for agile

19
00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:44,719
you can compare your list to the one i

20
00:00:41,719 --> 00:00:44,719
created
