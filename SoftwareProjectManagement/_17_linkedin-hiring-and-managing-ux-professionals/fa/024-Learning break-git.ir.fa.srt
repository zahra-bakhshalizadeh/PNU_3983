00:00:00,01 --> 00:00:07,08
(lively music)

2
00:00:07,08 --> 00:00:09,02
- On my LinkedIn profile,

3
00:00:09,02 --> 00:00:11,08
I actually write and it says in my description,

4
00:00:11,08 --> 00:00:14,09
if you're interested in having me do some work for you

5
00:00:14,09 --> 00:00:16,08
in some context or other,

6
00:00:16,08 --> 00:00:19,04
please email me first, don't call me.

7
00:00:19,04 --> 00:00:22,03
It's not that I don't want to talk with recruiters,

8
00:00:22,03 --> 00:00:25,01
but I get so much junk

9
00:00:25,01 --> 00:00:26,02
which is like someone calling,

10
00:00:26,02 --> 00:00:30,07
"Hi, I'm so and so from this tech company

11
00:00:30,07 --> 00:00:33,04
"and we are looking for this wonderful position."

12
00:00:33,04 --> 00:00:35,01
I'm like well, that's not what I do.

13
00:00:35,01 --> 00:00:38,06
And they're like, "Oh but it pays this wonderful amount."

14
00:00:38,06 --> 00:00:40,03
It doesn't sound so good to me.

15
00:00:40,03 --> 00:00:43,02
"Oh, I see you're a freelancer.

16
00:00:43,02 --> 00:00:45,09
"This is long-term full time."

17
00:00:45,09 --> 00:00:47,02
Well, I still don't want it.

18
00:00:47,02 --> 00:00:51,01
"But come on, can you tell your friends about it?"

19
00:00:51,01 --> 00:00:52,06
No.

20
00:00:52,06 --> 00:00:54,01
I get so many of those,

21
00:00:54,01 --> 00:00:56,03
those calls, those emails of like,

22
00:00:56,03 --> 00:00:58,03
it's totally misaligned

23
00:00:58,03 --> 00:01:01,02
but versus the amazing recruiter

24
00:01:01,02 --> 00:01:02,09
who calls, even if I'm not interested,

25
00:01:02,09 --> 00:01:05,04
they say, "I recently read your blog

26
00:01:05,04 --> 00:01:06,06
"about such and such

27
00:01:06,06 --> 00:01:07,07
"and it was so interesting to me

28
00:01:07,07 --> 00:01:09,06
"because I'm also learning about UX

29
00:01:09,06 --> 00:01:11,01
"and I understood this concept

30
00:01:11,01 --> 00:01:12,09
"and it was so meaningful to me.

31
00:01:12,09 --> 00:01:14,08
"Oh and by the way, I looked at your profile

32
00:01:14,08 --> 00:01:17,01
"and see you've been traveling a lot lately,

33
00:01:17,01 --> 00:01:18,09
"so I'm sure you're really busy right now

34
00:01:18,09 --> 00:01:21,03
"but when you get home next time

35
00:01:21,03 --> 00:01:22,09
"and you want to talk,

36
00:01:22,09 --> 00:01:24,03
"I've got this great thing for you

37
00:01:24,03 --> 00:01:26,05
"and here's why it's great and so."

38
00:01:26,05 --> 00:01:28,05
Wow, I do want to talk to you

39
00:01:28,05 --> 00:01:30,06
even if I'm not interested in the job,

40
00:01:30,06 --> 00:01:31,08
you care about me.

41
00:01:31,08 --> 00:01:35,04
You understand who I am, you understand me.

42
00:01:35,04 --> 00:01:37,00
The best thing that someone can actually do

43
00:01:37,00 --> 00:01:39,02
is learn UX.

44
00:01:39,02 --> 00:01:40,09
Learn the language of UX,

45
00:01:40,09 --> 00:01:43,00
learn the terminology,

46
00:01:43,00 --> 00:01:44,08
learn what UX is about.

47
00:01:44,08 --> 00:01:45,08
It doesn't mean every nuance

48
00:01:45,08 --> 00:01:49,05
of every software application someone might use

49
00:01:49,05 --> 00:01:51,01
but at least at the big picture,

50
00:01:51,01 --> 00:01:55,01
understand that umbrella of UX skills,

51
00:01:55,01 --> 00:01:58,00
of UX job types

52
00:01:58,00 --> 00:01:59,06
that someone may have.

53
00:01:59,06 --> 00:02:02,04
Understand the big picture and that said,

54
00:02:02,04 --> 00:02:04,01
certainly I would recommend

55
00:02:04,01 --> 00:02:08,08
that hiring managers, that recruiters go

56
00:02:08,08 --> 00:02:10,07
to UX meetups

57
00:02:10,07 --> 00:02:12,07
and when they go to a UX meetup,

58
00:02:12,07 --> 00:02:14,08
they start learning the language of UX,

59
00:02:14,08 --> 00:02:16,02
they start hearing from speakers,

60
00:02:16,02 --> 00:02:17,02
they start meeting people

61
00:02:17,02 --> 00:02:18,09
and again, it's similar

62
00:02:18,09 --> 00:02:21,09
to any other situation where if they go to people

63
00:02:21,09 --> 00:02:22,09
and say, "Okay, I'm a recruiter

64
00:02:22,09 --> 00:02:24,08
"and I need you right now."

65
00:02:24,08 --> 00:02:26,02
It's a bit overwhelming

66
00:02:26,02 --> 00:02:27,08
but if they just go, "Hey, I'm interested

67
00:02:27,08 --> 00:02:29,03
"in learning about UX, I'm a recruiter,

68
00:02:29,03 --> 00:02:32,03
"I recruit for these positions, not for a specific need,

69
00:02:32,03 --> 00:02:35,02
"I just want to understand better UX

70
00:02:35,02 --> 00:02:36,07
"and the people that do UX

71
00:02:36,07 --> 00:02:39,03
"and the types of UX jobs within that umbrella

72
00:02:39,03 --> 00:02:42,09
"and it's about my learning as the hiring manager,

73
00:02:42,09 --> 00:02:44,02
"as the recruiter."

74
00:02:44,02 --> 00:02:48,00
That is oh so important.
