00:00:00,07 --> 00:00:03,07


- Running a project is like maintaining a home.



2

00:00:03,07 --> 00:00:07,01

There are always repairs and improvements to be done.



3

00:00:07,01 --> 00:00:10,03

But when you consider repairs and improvements to your home,



4

00:00:10,03 --> 00:00:13,01

you also have to consider three things.



5

00:00:13,01 --> 00:00:15,01

How soon do I need it done?



6

00:00:15,01 --> 00:00:17,02

How much do I have in the bank to pay for it?



7

00:00:17,02 --> 00:00:21,02

And what tasks will get it done the way I want?



8

00:00:21,02 --> 00:00:23,06

The same thing happens in businesses,



9

00:00:23,06 --> 00:00:26,06

and these three things are known in the project world



10

00:00:26,06 --> 00:00:28,03

as the triple constraint.



11

00:00:28,03 --> 00:00:30,06

You may have heard of it as the iron triangle



12

00:00:30,06 --> 00:00:32,05

or the project management triangle,



13

00:00:32,05 --> 00:00:34,04

but it means the same thing.



14

00:00:34,04 --> 00:00:36,05

The triple constraint is really all



15

00:00:36,05 --> 00:00:40,00

about managing cost, scope, and time.



16

00:00:40,00 --> 00:00:42,07

Let's talk about cost first.



17

00:00:42,07 --> 00:00:45,08

With cost we ask, what are the financial limitations



18

00:00:45,08 --> 00:00:48,04

that the project can't exceed?



19

00:00:48,04 --> 00:00:51,02

And remember, as you're going through this planning,



20

00:00:51,02 --> 00:00:54,06

you need to ensure that you're counting everything.



21

00:00:54,06 --> 00:00:57,01

Labor cost, so it's the people on your team.



22

00:00:57,01 --> 00:00:59,04

It's the labor of people you're going to bring in



23

00:00:59,04 --> 00:01:00,07

once in awhile.



24

00:01:00,07 --> 00:01:01,05

It's equipment.



25

00:01:01,05 --> 00:01:03,05

Do you need new equipment for this project?



26

00:01:03,05 --> 00:01:06,02

Do you need new hardware or new software to do the work?



27

00:01:06,02 --> 00:01:07,01

Oh, and vendors.



28

00:01:07,01 --> 00:01:09,09

Are you going to hire any outside vendors



29

00:01:09,09 --> 00:01:12,09

to do work for you on an hourly basis?



30

00:01:12,09 --> 00:01:15,02

So you'll need to bake all of that in.



31

00:01:15,02 --> 00:01:16,03

In the waterfall method,



32

00:01:16,03 --> 00:01:19,01

cost is set at the initiating phase of the project,



33

00:01:19,01 --> 00:01:21,09

and it can't be changed, just like we talked about,



34

00:01:21,09 --> 00:01:25,00

unless you get an approved project change request done.



35

00:01:25,00 --> 00:01:27,00

So you'd have to go back through your steering committee



36

00:01:27,00 --> 00:01:30,04

and make sure everyone's okay with that additional cost.



37

00:01:30,04 --> 00:01:33,01

Next, you'll need to think about scope.



38

00:01:33,01 --> 00:01:36,02

In dealing with scope, you really need to ask yourself,



39

00:01:36,02 --> 00:01:39,03

what are all the features we need to complete



40

00:01:39,03 --> 00:01:42,02

in order to deliver the value that we need?



41

00:01:42,02 --> 00:01:44,03

During planning, you're going to start thinking



42

00:01:44,03 --> 00:01:48,08

about how much time, how much effort is it going to take,



43

00:01:48,08 --> 00:01:50,02

and then you're going to match



44

00:01:50,02 --> 00:01:52,09

that time and effort and those estimates



45

00:01:52,09 --> 00:01:56,03

against possible work item that needs to be done.



46

00:01:56,03 --> 00:01:58,03

As you go through this process,



47

00:01:58,03 --> 00:02:00,07

you're going to compare that against your cost,



48

00:02:00,07 --> 00:02:02,07

so now you're going to lock down the scope



49

00:02:02,07 --> 00:02:04,03

that will fit within that cost



50

00:02:04,03 --> 00:02:07,08

by doing that analysis and that comparison.



51

00:02:07,08 --> 00:02:10,04

Finally, let's talk about time.



52

00:02:10,04 --> 00:02:12,04

What we need to know about time is



53

00:02:12,04 --> 00:02:16,08

what's the estimated schedule to complete this job



54

00:02:16,08 --> 00:02:19,03

to give the deliverable that we need?



55

00:02:19,03 --> 00:02:20,03

So you're going to take



56

00:02:20,03 --> 00:02:22,03

into consideration things like deadlines.



57

00:02:22,03 --> 00:02:24,05

Is there a specific window



58

00:02:24,05 --> 00:02:26,02

that you have to finish this in?



59

00:02:26,02 --> 00:02:28,04

For example, I once ran a project



60

00:02:28,04 --> 00:02:30,07

to set up a new financial accounting system,



61

00:02:30,07 --> 00:02:33,01

but I also knew that I could only deliver that



62

00:02:33,01 --> 00:02:34,04

in the middle of a quarter.



63

00:02:34,04 --> 00:02:37,05

I couldn't deliver that at the end of a quarter



64

00:02:37,05 --> 00:02:40,07

when it's not acceptable for our accountants



65

00:02:40,07 --> 00:02:42,03

to be working on new software.



66

00:02:42,03 --> 00:02:43,08

They need time.



67

00:02:43,08 --> 00:02:45,02

So at the end of planning,



68

00:02:45,02 --> 00:02:49,05

you're going to lock those time schedule boundaries.



69

00:02:49,05 --> 00:02:52,01

They're going to be in sync with the work



70

00:02:52,01 --> 00:02:54,02

that needs to be done that you've already estimated.



71

00:02:54,02 --> 00:02:57,07

It's going to be in sync with the window that you have



72

00:02:57,07 --> 00:03:02,01

for releasing your project and your deliverable.



73

00:03:02,01 --> 00:03:06,01

So the nice thing is that you can use the triple constraint



74

00:03:06,01 --> 00:03:08,04

to evaluate project success.



75

00:03:08,04 --> 00:03:10,02

It's kind of a double-edged sword.



76

00:03:10,02 --> 00:03:14,07

So from this perspective, from waterfall's perspective,



77

00:03:14,07 --> 00:03:16,03

the perfect project means



78

00:03:16,03 --> 00:03:18,08

that you've completed all of the scope



79

00:03:18,08 --> 00:03:22,09

within your allotted time and using all or less



80

00:03:22,09 --> 00:03:25,04

than the cost that was established.



81

00:03:25,04 --> 00:03:28,08

The strict interpretation of waterfall says any violation



82

00:03:28,08 --> 00:03:32,03

of the triple constraint in any one of the categories



83

00:03:32,03 --> 00:03:35,00

means your project was unsuccessful.



84

00:03:35,00 --> 00:03:36,03

On the plus side,



85

00:03:36,03 --> 00:03:38,07

there are benefits to the triple constraint.



86

00:03:38,07 --> 00:03:42,05

The teams and leaders are on the same page at all times



87

00:03:42,05 --> 00:03:45,03

in relation to time, scope, and cost.



88

00:03:45,03 --> 00:03:47,05

Everybody has the same expectations,



89

00:03:47,05 --> 00:03:50,04

and everybody's working toward that same goal.



90

00:03:50,04 --> 00:03:51,05

From this perspective,



91

00:03:51,05 --> 00:03:54,00

the PM can easily identify variables



92

00:03:54,00 --> 00:03:56,06

that are going to impact those project constraints.



93

00:03:56,06 --> 00:03:59,08

So as something comes up, the project manager will compare



94

00:03:59,08 --> 00:04:01,04

against time, cost, and scope



95

00:04:01,04 --> 00:04:03,08

and make sure that there are no changes



96

00:04:03,08 --> 00:04:06,04

that require a change request.



97

00:04:06,04 --> 00:04:09,09

Project management is really a juggling act.



98

00:04:09,09 --> 00:04:14,01

You have to make trade-offs to deliver value



99

00:04:14,01 --> 00:04:16,08

without violating the constraints.



100

00:04:16,08 --> 00:04:20,08

Let's go back to our home repair analogy for an example.



101

00:04:20,08 --> 00:04:22,07

Let's say you set aside the month of June



102

00:04:22,07 --> 00:04:24,05

to install new windows in your kitchen



103

00:04:24,05 --> 00:04:26,07

to improve energy efficiency.



104

00:04:26,07 --> 00:04:29,02

You have the money to have the work completed.



105

00:04:29,02 --> 00:04:30,09

So far it looks like you're clear



106

00:04:30,09 --> 00:04:33,08

on your time, your cost, and your scope.



107

00:04:33,08 --> 00:04:36,02

But maybe you learn about a new type



108

00:04:36,02 --> 00:04:38,04

of more attractive window.



109

00:04:38,04 --> 00:04:40,05

Like any good project manager,



110

00:04:40,05 --> 00:04:42,07

you'll review this option to determine



111

00:04:42,07 --> 00:04:45,02

if it can be completed in the month of June



112

00:04:45,02 --> 00:04:47,02

for the same or lower cost



113

00:04:47,02 --> 00:04:50,08

and still deliver the needed energy efficiency.



114

00:04:50,08 --> 00:04:52,05

When you balance the triple constraints



115

00:04:52,05 --> 00:04:54,03

throughout your project,



116

00:04:54,03 --> 00:04:57,06

you'll be able to get the outcome your leaders expect.
