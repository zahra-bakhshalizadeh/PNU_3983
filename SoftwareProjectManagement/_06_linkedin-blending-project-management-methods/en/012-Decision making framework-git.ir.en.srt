00:00:00,09 --> 00:00:04,00
- Two frameworks: Agile and Waterfall.



2

00:00:04,00 --> 00:00:07,08

Each has its own process: empirical and defined.



3

00:00:07,08 --> 00:00:10,06

Each has its own set of weaknesses.



4

00:00:10,06 --> 00:00:15,06

So how do you choose which to use for your project?



5

00:00:15,06 --> 00:00:19,05

Well, now that we know the strengths and weaknesses of each,



6

00:00:19,05 --> 00:00:21,09

let's use them to create a framework



7

00:00:21,09 --> 00:00:24,00

for making our decision.



8

00:00:24,00 --> 00:00:26,00

We'll also make some inferences



9

00:00:26,00 --> 00:00:28,05

about where each methodology lands



10

00:00:28,05 --> 00:00:31,02

based on strengths and weaknesses.



11

00:00:31,02 --> 00:00:33,02

Let's take a look at this matrix.



12

00:00:33,02 --> 00:00:35,05

There are nine criteria you can use



13

00:00:35,05 --> 00:00:38,00

to select which methodology will be



14

00:00:38,00 --> 00:00:40,03

better suited to your project.



15

00:00:40,03 --> 00:00:43,01

Let's talk about the criteria shown here,



16

00:00:43,01 --> 00:00:46,01

starting with time, cost, and scope.



17

00:00:46,01 --> 00:00:49,07

We know that Waterfall demands all three be fixed.



18

00:00:49,07 --> 00:00:52,09

When that's the case, Waterfall makes sense.



19

00:00:52,09 --> 00:00:56,01

From an Agile perspective, remember that Agile



20

00:00:56,01 --> 00:01:01,00

will fix time and cost so that scope can be flexible.



21

00:01:01,00 --> 00:01:04,09

I've shown all three as fixed or variable on the chart.



22

00:01:04,09 --> 00:01:08,06

This is simply to reflect that while time and cost are



23

00:01:08,06 --> 00:01:13,08

fixed, they can and do vary based on customer request.



24

00:01:13,08 --> 00:01:16,07

Agile can also work with a fixed scope.



25

00:01:16,07 --> 00:01:21,04

So fixing the scope is not a deterrent to selecting Agile.



26

00:01:21,04 --> 00:01:24,09

When we get to complexity, we recognize that Agile



27

00:01:24,09 --> 00:01:26,08

is a better fit for projects



28

00:01:26,08 --> 00:01:29,08

that are complex or complicated.



29

00:01:29,08 --> 00:01:32,06

The inspect and adapt model is flexible



30

00:01:32,06 --> 00:01:34,09

and enables navigation through



31

00:01:34,09 --> 00:01:38,03

unknown and unpredictable situations.



32

00:01:38,03 --> 00:01:41,05

The inflexibility of Waterfall makes it



33

00:01:41,05 --> 00:01:44,06

difficult to use in these scenarios.



34

00:01:44,06 --> 00:01:48,05

Next is considering the customer's availability.



35

00:01:48,05 --> 00:01:50,08

If they're intermittently available,



36

00:01:50,08 --> 00:01:52,08

Waterfall is a better choice because



37

00:01:52,08 --> 00:01:55,09

they'll be needed only at milestones.



38

00:01:55,09 --> 00:01:58,09

Then, consider the team construct.



39

00:01:58,09 --> 00:02:02,07

Is the team size smaller than 10 and dedicated?



40

00:02:02,07 --> 00:02:06,08

If yes on both counts, Agile is a better choice.



41

00:02:06,08 --> 00:02:10,02

For projects with more people that aren't dedicated,



42

00:02:10,02 --> 00:02:12,06

Waterfall is a better option.



43

00:02:12,06 --> 00:02:16,07

Now, let's consider requirement clarity.



44

00:02:16,07 --> 00:02:19,04

Perhaps the project outcome is clear,



45

00:02:19,04 --> 00:02:22,09

but the solution for achieving it isn't clear.



46

00:02:22,09 --> 00:02:25,01

Maybe there's new technology involved,



47

00:02:25,01 --> 00:02:28,04

or a new implementation of existing technology.



48

00:02:28,04 --> 00:02:31,05

When the solution, and therefore requirements,



49

00:02:31,05 --> 00:02:36,07

are unknown or evolving, Agile is a better choice.



50

00:02:36,07 --> 00:02:40,08

Next, what is the customer's success criteria?



51

00:02:40,08 --> 00:02:44,08

If they're more interested in fixed time and cost



52

00:02:44,08 --> 00:02:48,08

with a flexible scope, Agile is your better option.



53

00:02:48,08 --> 00:02:50,09

If they need all three to be fixed,



54

00:02:50,09 --> 00:02:53,04

Waterfall may better suit them.



55

00:02:53,04 --> 00:02:55,09

Finally, does the customer have



56

00:02:55,09 --> 00:02:59,02

a preferred delivery preference?



57

00:02:59,02 --> 00:03:01,08

If they're comfortable with, and will receive value



58

00:03:01,08 --> 00:03:04,03

from incremental delivery throughout the life



59

00:03:04,03 --> 00:03:07,05

of the project, definitely go with Agile.



60

00:03:07,05 --> 00:03:10,02

If, however, there's no value to be gained



61

00:03:10,02 --> 00:03:14,03

from frequent deliveries, Waterfall is a good choice.



62

00:03:14,03 --> 00:03:17,07

Every project and situation will be different.



63

00:03:17,07 --> 00:03:20,08

This framework, however, will give you context



64

00:03:20,08 --> 00:03:23,02

through which you can easily identify



65

00:03:23,02 --> 00:03:26,07

which methodology is right for your project.
