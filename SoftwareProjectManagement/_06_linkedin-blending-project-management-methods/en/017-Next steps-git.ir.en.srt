00:00:00,08 --> 00:00:02,05


- Knowing that our organization



2

00:00:02,05 --> 00:00:05,00

is changing can be unsettling.



3

00:00:05,00 --> 00:00:07,08

But preparing ourselves by learning



4

00:00:07,08 --> 00:00:10,00

positions us to be successful



5

00:00:10,00 --> 00:00:13,04

and can make us the leaders of the change.



6

00:00:13,04 --> 00:00:15,03

As your organization moves forward



7

00:00:15,03 --> 00:00:18,04

with both agile and waterfall methodologies,



8

00:00:18,04 --> 00:00:21,06

learn everything you can about both.



9

00:00:21,06 --> 00:00:23,03

By taking this step,



10

00:00:23,03 --> 00:00:24,07

you'll be ready to lead



11

00:00:24,07 --> 00:00:27,07

the organization as it changes.



12

00:00:27,07 --> 00:00:30,01

As you start this process of learning,



13

00:00:30,01 --> 00:00:32,01

I recommend you check out my course



14

00:00:32,01 --> 00:00:35,00

on transitioning from waterfall to agile.



15

00:00:35,00 --> 00:00:37,02

Also, take some time to watch



16

00:00:37,02 --> 00:00:39,08

the Agile at Work series with Doug Rose.



17

00:00:39,08 --> 00:00:41,02

These courses will deepen



18

00:00:41,02 --> 00:00:44,08

your understanding of both methodologies.



19

00:00:44,08 --> 00:00:47,09

I hope that you've already started exploring.



20

00:00:47,09 --> 00:00:49,01

There are many approaches



21

00:00:49,01 --> 00:00:50,03

to the triple constraints



22

00:00:50,03 --> 00:00:52,02

in both methodologies.



23

00:00:52,02 --> 00:00:54,02

Further, if you can start



24

00:00:54,02 --> 00:00:56,07

to incrementally shift your portfolio



25

00:00:56,07 --> 00:00:58,04

into a single report,



26

00:00:58,04 --> 00:00:59,09

your organization will be



27

00:00:59,09 --> 00:01:02,08

much healthier for your efforts.



28

00:01:02,08 --> 00:01:04,09

Don't hesitate to share your stories



29

00:01:04,09 --> 00:01:06,02

with me on LinkedIn.



30

00:01:06,02 --> 00:01:08,05

I'd love to hear about your experiences



31

00:01:08,05 --> 00:01:11,04

and answer any questions you may have.



32

00:01:11,04 --> 00:01:14,01

Best of luck to you, your teams,



33

00:01:14,01 --> 00:01:16,00

and your portfolios.
