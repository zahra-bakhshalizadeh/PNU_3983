1

00:00:00,09 --> 00:00:03,02
- Independent projects are fairly simple



2

00:00:03,02 --> 00:00:04,06

to manage and track.



3

00:00:04,06 --> 00:00:07,03

Things get a little trickier when you have projects



4

00:00:07,03 --> 00:00:09,04

that are dependent on each other.



5

00:00:09,04 --> 00:00:13,04

Remember, a program is simply a group of related projects.



6

00:00:13,04 --> 00:00:17,09

Each project has a portion of the overall program goal.



7

00:00:17,09 --> 00:00:21,07

It's also good to remember that all the independent projects



8

00:00:21,07 --> 00:00:24,03

plus all the programs together make up



9

00:00:24,03 --> 00:00:27,09

the whole portfolio of work in your organization.



10

00:00:27,09 --> 00:00:30,04

So, how do you take the project level reporting



11

00:00:30,04 --> 00:00:34,01

and pull it tother into a program or portfolio?



12

00:00:34,01 --> 00:00:36,06

And really, the hardest question is



13

00:00:36,06 --> 00:00:38,07

how do you create a cohesive view



14

00:00:38,07 --> 00:00:41,00

into the health of your portfolio



15

00:00:41,00 --> 00:00:44,07

when you have both Agile and Waterfall projects.



16

00:00:44,07 --> 00:00:46,08

Well, let's start with the basics.



17

00:00:46,08 --> 00:00:49,06

We know that in Waterfall time, cost,



18

00:00:49,06 --> 00:00:52,01

and scope are all locked at the beginning.



19

00:00:52,01 --> 00:00:54,01

At a minimum, these three data points



20

00:00:54,01 --> 00:00:56,03

need to be represented for the projects,



21

00:00:56,03 --> 00:00:58,04

the programs, and the whole portfolio.



22

00:00:58,04 --> 00:01:02,06

In Agile, we know that time and cost are fixed,



23

00:01:02,06 --> 00:01:04,08

but scope is flexible.



24

00:01:04,08 --> 00:01:08,02

Now, are the teams really building anything they want?



25

00:01:08,02 --> 00:01:09,03

Of course not.



26

00:01:09,03 --> 00:01:12,06

There's still a desired outcome that guides the work.



27

00:01:12,06 --> 00:01:16,00

It's not specific scope items we need in site two,



28

00:01:16,00 --> 00:01:19,04

it's progress toward that overall objective.



29

00:01:19,04 --> 00:01:22,04

So, while similar, these are different enough



30

00:01:22,04 --> 00:01:25,05

that we need to find a way to create a report



31

00:01:25,05 --> 00:01:29,03

that's accurate for both Waterfall and Agile projects



32

00:01:29,03 --> 00:01:32,01

in programs in our portfolio.



33

00:01:32,01 --> 00:01:35,02

As you know, each individual project



34

00:01:35,02 --> 00:01:38,08

usually reports their status to a program manager.



35

00:01:38,08 --> 00:01:42,02

One of the program managers, or the portfolio leader,



36

00:01:42,02 --> 00:01:44,08

pulls everything together for a cohesive view



37

00:01:44,08 --> 00:01:47,00

into the whole portfolio.



38

00:01:47,00 --> 00:01:50,01

Let's look at an example of portfolio reporting



39

00:01:50,01 --> 00:01:54,04

when both Agile and Waterfall projects are in progress.



40

00:01:54,04 --> 00:01:57,00

Let's say our portfolio leader,



41

00:01:57,00 --> 00:01:59,03

Anaya, needs to build a report.



42

00:01:59,03 --> 00:02:02,06

Her typical status report could look like this.



43

00:02:02,06 --> 00:02:04,02

Notice the top row.



44

00:02:04,02 --> 00:02:09,00

In this area, Anaya has summarized their overall portfolio.



45

00:02:09,00 --> 00:02:11,09

She's showing the portfolio is in yellow,



46

00:02:11,09 --> 00:02:15,08

or at risk status and trending to remain that way.



47

00:02:15,08 --> 00:02:20,03

Then she exposes the program budget as over budget



48

00:02:20,03 --> 00:02:25,01

and indicates that one project is triggering this status.



49

00:02:25,01 --> 00:02:28,04

Leaders can then dive into the details below



50

00:02:28,04 --> 00:02:33,04

to review each individual project and easily see its status.



51

00:02:33,04 --> 00:02:36,01

The real value of this unified report



52

00:02:36,01 --> 00:02:39,08

lies in the columns of the table below.



53

00:02:39,08 --> 00:02:43,04

Here we can see both the schedule and scope



54

00:02:43,04 --> 00:02:46,03

as key metrics revealing our progress.



55

00:02:46,03 --> 00:02:48,01

We can see the planned schedule



56

00:02:48,01 --> 00:02:50,01

with the start and finish dates,



57

00:02:50,01 --> 00:02:51,05

then we can see the percent



58

00:02:51,05 --> 00:02:54,04

of the schedule that has elapsed.



59

00:02:54,04 --> 00:02:58,09

Next we see our progress toward our features or scope.



60

00:02:58,09 --> 00:03:02,06

Remember, in Agile we track feature completion.



61

00:03:02,06 --> 00:03:06,00

What those features are can fluctuate.



62

00:03:06,00 --> 00:03:08,07

In Waterfall, we track scope completion.



63

00:03:08,07 --> 00:03:12,09

Here we see the percent features or scope complete.



64

00:03:12,09 --> 00:03:15,08

That tells our leaders how the effort is tracking



65

00:03:15,08 --> 00:03:19,06

toward their overall progress toward their objective.



66

00:03:19,06 --> 00:03:21,02

The projects and programs will



67

00:03:21,02 --> 00:03:23,01

get to the number differently,



68

00:03:23,01 --> 00:03:25,07

but both can be reflected accurately



69

00:03:25,07 --> 00:03:29,00

and uniformly in the same report.



70

00:03:29,00 --> 00:03:32,01

In Agile, the calculation is total completed



71

00:03:32,01 --> 00:03:35,01

story points divided by total story points.



72

00:03:35,01 --> 00:03:39,05

For example, an Agile project with 200 points completed



73

00:03:39,05 --> 00:03:43,09

out of an expected 400 points is 50% complete.



74

00:03:43,09 --> 00:03:46,04

In Waterfall, the calculation is



75

00:03:46,04 --> 00:03:49,01

the completion of the major milestones.



76

00:03:49,01 --> 00:03:52,06

If three major milestones have been completed out of six,



77

00:03:52,06 --> 00:03:55,06

it too is 50% complete.



78

00:03:55,06 --> 00:03:59,09

When your portfolio has both Agile and Waterfall projects



79

00:03:59,09 --> 00:04:02,02

you can still use a single report



80

00:04:02,02 --> 00:04:05,01

to share progress with your leaders.



81

00:04:05,01 --> 00:04:07,04

When you do, you'll help them see



82

00:04:07,04 --> 00:04:11,04

that both methodologies can live happily together.
