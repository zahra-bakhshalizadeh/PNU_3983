1

00:00:00,07 --> 00:00:04,03
- Unfortunately, the words complicated and complex



2

00:00:04,03 --> 00:00:06,00

are used interchangeably,



3

00:00:06,00 --> 00:00:08,02

but they don't mean the same thing.



4

00:00:08,02 --> 00:00:11,05

When you use them in the context of projects,



5

00:00:11,05 --> 00:00:15,02

the difference can make or break your work effort.



6

00:00:15,02 --> 00:00:18,01

There's a scale that's used to define difficulty



7

00:00:18,01 --> 00:00:22,03

in relation to problems, systems, or processes.



8

00:00:22,03 --> 00:00:24,08

There are four categories on this scale,



9

00:00:24,08 --> 00:00:29,05

simple, complex, complicated, or chaotic.



10

00:00:29,05 --> 00:00:31,04

Let's look at each one.



11

00:00:31,04 --> 00:00:34,02

First, let's talk about simple problems,



12

00:00:34,02 --> 00:00:36,01

systems, or processes.



13

00:00:36,01 --> 00:00:39,08

Simple things are predictable and easy to understand.



14

00:00:39,08 --> 00:00:43,05

An example of something that's simple is a sail.



15

00:00:43,05 --> 00:00:47,04

Sails have been used for millennia as a way to move boats.



16

00:00:47,04 --> 00:00:50,07

It's easy for me to predict that a large sheet of fabric,



17

00:00:50,07 --> 00:00:54,02

exposed to wind, will catch it and propel the sheet



18

00:00:54,02 --> 00:00:57,02

and anything connected to it forward.



19

00:00:57,02 --> 00:00:59,02

As you can tell, simple things



20

00:00:59,02 --> 00:01:02,06

are easily understood and predictable.



21

00:01:02,06 --> 00:01:06,04

Second on this scale are things that are complicated.



22

00:01:06,04 --> 00:01:09,01

Complicated things are harder to understand,



23

00:01:09,01 --> 00:01:11,00

but are still knowable.



24

00:01:11,00 --> 00:01:14,07

An example of something complicated is a sailboat.



25

00:01:14,07 --> 00:01:18,04

While I'm not a sailor, if I spent the necessary time



26

00:01:18,04 --> 00:01:21,08

and effort, I could learn everything there is to know



27

00:01:21,08 --> 00:01:23,06

about a sailboat.



28

00:01:23,06 --> 00:01:27,03

I would fully understand what each piece and part does



29

00:01:27,03 --> 00:01:29,02

and how to control it.



30

00:01:29,02 --> 00:01:30,09

Once I knew these things,



31

00:01:30,09 --> 00:01:34,06

I could maintain and care for a boat on my own.



32

00:01:34,06 --> 00:01:39,06

The boat, then, becomes both knowable and predictable.



33

00:01:39,06 --> 00:01:44,01

For example, if I remove a plank from the bottom of my boat,



34

00:01:44,01 --> 00:01:47,05

I can predict that the boat will sink.



35

00:01:47,05 --> 00:01:50,09

Next on the scale are things that are complex.



36

00:01:50,09 --> 00:01:55,01

Complexity means that I can never fully know everything



37

00:01:55,01 --> 00:01:57,02

about the object of my study.



38

00:01:57,02 --> 00:02:00,05

I can learn and practice to a certain level,



39

00:02:00,05 --> 00:02:03,09

and only make educated guesses about the outcomes



40

00:02:03,09 --> 00:02:05,08

from different scenarios.



41

00:02:05,08 --> 00:02:08,08

This arena is unpredictable.



42

00:02:08,08 --> 00:02:10,09

Staying with our sailboat example,



43

00:02:10,09 --> 00:02:13,06

sailing on the ocean is complex.



44

00:02:13,06 --> 00:02:17,02

There is no way to fully predict the ocean currents,



45

00:02:17,02 --> 00:02:20,03

the weather, or how my boat will behave



46

00:02:20,03 --> 00:02:22,00

in various conditions.



47

00:02:22,00 --> 00:02:25,08

In this case, all I can do is make educated guesses



48

00:02:25,08 --> 00:02:27,06

on the actions I should take



49

00:02:27,06 --> 00:02:30,04

and the outcomes that might result.



50

00:02:30,04 --> 00:02:33,04

In other words, it's not fully understandable,



51

00:02:33,04 --> 00:02:36,01

but I can still make some predictions.



52

00:02:36,01 --> 00:02:40,05

As a result, I need to act, learn, and adapt.



53

00:02:40,05 --> 00:02:44,03

Finally, at the top of the scale is chaos.



54

00:02:44,03 --> 00:02:46,00

Chaos reigns when something



55

00:02:46,00 --> 00:02:49,00

is not understandable or predictable.



56

00:02:49,00 --> 00:02:52,03

Still using our sailing example, putting my sailboat



57

00:02:52,03 --> 00:02:54,07

in a hurricane is chaotic.



58

00:02:54,07 --> 00:02:57,04

I can neither understand nor predict



59

00:02:57,04 --> 00:03:01,06

what will happen to me or my boat in this scenario.



60

00:03:01,06 --> 00:03:05,04

When it comes to projects, it's essential to understand



61

00:03:05,04 --> 00:03:08,04

where the project exists on this scale.



62

00:03:08,04 --> 00:03:13,04

Is it simple, complex, complicated, or chaotic?



63

00:03:13,04 --> 00:03:15,08

Once you know where your project is,



64

00:03:15,08 --> 00:03:17,01

you have a better chance



65

00:03:17,01 --> 00:03:19,09

of selecting the right methodology for success.
