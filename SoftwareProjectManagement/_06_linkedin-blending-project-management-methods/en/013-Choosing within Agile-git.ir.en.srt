1

00:00:00,07 --> 00:00:02,05
- Once your project is up and running,



2

00:00:02,05 --> 00:00:04,04

it's expected that the project manager



3

00:00:04,04 --> 00:00:06,08

will track how the team is performing.



4

00:00:06,08 --> 00:00:10,01

Remember, in Waterfall, the requirements are gathered



5

00:00:10,01 --> 00:00:13,02

and the plan is defined at the beginning of the effort,



6

00:00:13,02 --> 00:00:15,02

during the planning phase.



7

00:00:15,02 --> 00:00:17,04

So what are the levels of reporting?



8

00:00:17,04 --> 00:00:19,01

Well, there are actually three of them.



9

00:00:19,01 --> 00:00:22,07

First, is tracking progress by phase.



10

00:00:22,07 --> 00:00:25,07

Remember, each phase has an estimated time frame



11

00:00:25,07 --> 00:00:27,06

for duration and completion that's



12

00:00:27,06 --> 00:00:29,08

established in the beginning.



13

00:00:29,08 --> 00:00:31,07

Remember your phases that you're tracking



14

00:00:31,07 --> 00:00:36,00

are initiating, planning, executing and closing.



15

00:00:36,00 --> 00:00:39,03

Then you're also going to track within each phase.



16

00:00:39,03 --> 00:00:42,07

Each phase then, will have predefined milestones



17

00:00:42,07 --> 00:00:45,01

that will tell you whether or not



18

00:00:45,01 --> 00:00:48,03

that phase is on track to be completed



19

00:00:48,03 --> 00:00:51,05

within its estimated timeframe.



20

00:00:51,05 --> 00:00:54,02

So how are those milestones tracked?



21

00:00:54,02 --> 00:00:56,02

Well, it's actually pretty simple.



22

00:00:56,02 --> 00:00:58,05

You're going to identify all the tasks



23

00:00:58,05 --> 00:01:01,03

within each milestone that are needed to be done



24

00:01:01,03 --> 00:01:03,08

in order to complete the milestone.



25

00:01:03,08 --> 00:01:06,08

In the planning phase, you may have milestones within it,



26

00:01:06,08 --> 00:01:10,06

like signed statement of work, SOW for short,



27

00:01:10,06 --> 00:01:14,09

requirements review and estimates completed.



28

00:01:14,09 --> 00:01:19,02

For example, let's talk about breaking down a milestone.



29

00:01:19,02 --> 00:01:21,02

Let's use the signed statement of work,



30

00:01:21,02 --> 00:01:23,08

signed, the SOW, and the tasks



31

00:01:23,08 --> 00:01:25,08

that might be a part of that.



32

00:01:25,08 --> 00:01:27,08

Some of the tasks you might tackle here



33

00:01:27,08 --> 00:01:30,09

are receiving the statement of work from your vendor,



34

00:01:30,09 --> 00:01:33,05

doing a legal review with your in-house legal



35

00:01:33,05 --> 00:01:35,07

and then signing that statement of work.



36

00:01:35,07 --> 00:01:39,03

So you will track progress against each one of those tasks



37

00:01:39,03 --> 00:01:44,02

because each task is given a time estimate for completion.



38

00:01:44,02 --> 00:01:46,06

For example, the legal review task



39

00:01:46,06 --> 00:01:50,02

may have a four hour effort estimate for the work,



40

00:01:50,02 --> 00:01:54,01

and a five day window to complete those four hours.



41

00:01:54,01 --> 00:01:58,09

As the PM tracks the progress of these signed SOW milestone,



42

00:01:58,09 --> 00:02:01,07

she'll look at the targeted window for the work.



43

00:02:01,07 --> 00:02:04,05

Let's say July fifth through the ninth.



44

00:02:04,05 --> 00:02:06,05

Then she'll check on progress



45

00:02:06,05 --> 00:02:09,02

with the person assigned to the task.



46

00:02:09,02 --> 00:02:12,00

If it's Monday, and the task has started,



47

00:02:12,00 --> 00:02:15,06

she'll know the task is on target based on the plan.



48

00:02:15,06 --> 00:02:17,08

She'll also be confident that it will be complete



49

00:02:17,08 --> 00:02:20,03

by the ninth, so the task will be marked



50

00:02:20,03 --> 00:02:22,09

as being in good shape for the deadline.



51

00:02:22,09 --> 00:02:27,03

However, if it's the eighth and the task hasn't started



52

00:02:27,03 --> 00:02:30,06

the PM will know to take some corrective measures



53

00:02:30,06 --> 00:02:33,05

to get that task right back on track.



54

00:02:33,05 --> 00:02:36,08

At the same time, if the work has started,



55

00:02:36,08 --> 00:02:39,03

but more than four hours have been used,



56

00:02:39,03 --> 00:02:40,09

she'll know there's a problem,



57

00:02:40,09 --> 00:02:44,08

and we'll, again, take steps to fix things.



58

00:02:44,08 --> 00:02:47,03

That's how time and scope are managed.



59

00:02:47,03 --> 00:02:50,03

For budget, the PM will track the hours



60

00:02:50,03 --> 00:02:53,04

applied to each task against the estimates.



61

00:02:53,04 --> 00:02:55,04

All the work hours will be calculated



62

00:02:55,04 --> 00:02:58,07

and reduced from the project's total budget.



63

00:02:58,07 --> 00:03:01,01

Tracking team progress in Waterfall



64

00:03:01,01 --> 00:03:03,09

is a very detailed exercise of



65

00:03:03,09 --> 00:03:08,01

following the progress and cost of each task.



66

00:03:08,01 --> 00:03:11,00

Now that you know how Waterfall tracks progress,



67

00:03:11,00 --> 00:03:13,01

you can easily share this information



68

00:03:13,01 --> 00:03:14,08

with your stakeholders.
