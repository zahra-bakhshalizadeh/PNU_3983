> Ford-Fulkerson Algorithm for Maximum Flow Problem

## Introduction

*When a Graph Represent a Flow Network where every edge has a capacity. Also given that two vertices, source 's' and sink 't' in the graph, we can find the maximum possible flow from s to t with having following constraints:*

1. Flow on an edge doesn't exceed the given edge capacity
2. Incoming flow is equal to Outgoing flow for every vertex excluding sink and source

## Algorithm

1. Start with f(e) = 0 for all edge e âˆˆ E.
2. Find an augmenting path P in the residual graph Gf .
3. Augment flow along path P.
4. Repeat until you get stuck.

## Example

*Consider the following graph*
